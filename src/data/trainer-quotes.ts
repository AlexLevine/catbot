  '(This kid looks like a real sucker. All right!) Ohhhh, poor me! No one understands my art...',
  'I come here when I’m low in inspiration, hoping to find ideas for new creations. ',
  '...Heehee. I’m confident in my calculations and analysis. ',
  '...Shall we begin? Let’s see just how much of a fan you are... ',
  'A bit more color has been added to a page of my youthful memories... ',
  'A Butler without a master is really no more than a meddlesome old man.',
  'Being a meddlesome old man won’t keep me fed. Isn’t there a master out there for me? ',
  'A child like you cannot understand the kind of beauty that I am pursuing.',
  'To live life without a moment’s pause! Let’s enjoy the moment to the full! ',
  'A fragile ephemerality... Yes, that’s another of my charms...',
  'I need to get out of this place. My fairy tale is going to disappear! ',
  'A globe-trotting young adventurer. That’s me! ',
  'A hard chick like me doesn’t need anybody else to fight! My Pokémon are all the backup I need! ',
  'A harmony of strength and cuteness... That’s what I’m all about!',
  'No, no, that won’t do, it won’t do at all. When I’m in trouble, I feel farther away from fairy tales. ',
  'A hero never loses. A hero never dies. ',
  'A label is not important, is it? After all, you are yourself, right?',
  'I need to rethink my relationship with my Pokémon. ',
  'A man who is loved by the mountains... Guilty as charged... ',
  'A mountain maniac like me is properly called an alpinist. ',
  'A person who wants to fight, fight, and fight forever. That’s the way of the Ace.',
  'Are you aware of what it takes to be an Ace Trainer? ',
  'A serious battle starts from a serious beginning! Are you sure you’re ready? ',
  'A specialist in mountainous matters. That’s an alpinist. ',
  'A state of deep sorrow and confusion can also be art.',
  'And so I have produced another great work! ',
  'A strength equal to that of my master... I look forward to your future progress.',
  'It seems that your power is slightly insufficient to employ me. ',
  'A true Monsieur should accept the results of battle with a stoic mind.',
  'Ooh... Ooh... I can’t...stop crying... ',
  'A true Monsieur should bask in the elegant glow of his victory.',
  'Ha... Snicker snicker... I can’t...stop laughing... ',
  'A true Monsieur should have a liking for battles.',
  'A true Gentleman’s heart never wavers in battle. ',
  'A win for the love between me and my darling... It will burn forever!',
  'Marvelous! Fantastic! This feels like a dream! This is paradise for Trainers! ',
  'A-and I’m on my honeymoon, you got that?! That’s the most important point to remember!',
  'I’m traveling alone, so it’s fun not needing to worry about anyone else... ',
  'AAAH! I am sooo scared! I will never do it again... Sorry!',
  'Yes... You have good Pokémon... Pokémon must be happy to be raised by you... ',
  'Action painting? That’s, like, so last century. Art today is all about inaction.',
  'A battle with me is a test of your aesthetic sensibility. ',
  'Actually, this trip is just an excuse for me to keep running away from reality. ',
  'Adults don’t say what they’re really thinking, OK? You have to read between the lines to find the truth. ',
  'Adults have learned a lot of things kids don’t get. Like what is right...and what is fair... ',
  'Adventure is calling me. Farewell! See you again! ',
  'After I finish working at my part-time job, Pokémon battles soak gradually into my tired body. ',
  'After I was dumped by my boyfriend, I fell into depression. Before I knew it, I looked like this!',
  'Call me negative or whatever you like. This is just who I am. ',
  'Ah! Flowers and storms will be overcome! ♪ As I travel down the path of a battling woman! ♪ ',
  'Ah! I sense it! I sense your hypersensitive sensitivity!',
  'I don’t care for your disobedient attitude! Consider yourself expelled from your apprenticeship! ',
  'Ah! My muse! She has not abandoned me! I can feel it coming—the inspiration I need!',
  'I thought I could make money if I just bought some paper and some paint... ',
  'Ah, I shoulda known. Hey, don’t blame me.',
  'Even an amateur like me can win! Experience is the best teacher, so they say. ',
  'Ah, I tingle with excitement. I sure would like to fight...',
  'Heh... ',
  'Ah, my Pokémon lost... Maybe I’ll stick to studying. ',
  'Ah, you see? You didn’t focus on the battle. That’s why you lost. ',
  'Ah-roo! Let us have an elegant and unique battle. ',
  'Ah-roo-goo-lah! I was not confident of  my skills, so this is a delightful surprise. ',
  'Ah. You still have much to learn. Let me give you a crash course!',
  'Ahaha! Not yet! I’m not done yet! ',
  'Ah... Ah... Thank you... That was what I needed. ',
  'Ah... It’s hard. It sure is frustrating to lose.',
  'You and your Pokémon are nice! You’re doing great for your age! ',
  'Ah... You look strong... I hope I’ll be all right... ',
  'Ah... You weren’t bad... Which only makes me miserable... ',
  'Aha! Pokémon moves are so beautiful! I could almost faint!',
  'I get it. You have nothing but good Pokémon. ',
  'Ahaha! Cry! That’s it, cry for me! With that, this dish is complete! ',
  'Ahaha! There it is! That’s right! You’re already right at home in this world! ',
  'Ahaha-argh... ',
  'Ahahaha!!! ',
  'Ahahaha! ',
  'Ahh... I want to have an all-night Pokémon-battle party! ',
  'Ahh... I’m starving... I’m too weak to even throw a Poké Ball... ',
  'Ahh... My partner broke down. What am I gonna do at the site tomorrow? ',
  'Ahhh! Blast! Where’d that useless husband of mine get off to now?!',
  'This was supposed to be a one-night stop. But before I knew it, we started staying in one place after the next. ',
  'Ahhh, a Trainer who looks gorgeous! I hope your battle is just as beautiful. ',
  'Ahhh, the Emperor of Eating is satiated! I polished off your Pokémon in no time! ',
  'Ahhh... I knew I’d be terrible at it... I can’t call myself a Trainer like this...',
  'I told you to wait a second! It’s just that my strategy wasn’t ready yet! ',
  'Ahhh... It’s so fun and freeing... I guess I really am best suited to the single life...',
  'If I defeat my opponent, my tour won’t come to an end... ',
  'Ahhh... That’s a fine, good Pokémon you have. How would you fancy a wee trade?',
  'Even if you lack hopes or dreams, as long as you survive, you’ll become a Veteran someday. ',
  'Ahhhh! What a crock! If I can’t even conquer you, then who cares about conquering myself?!',
  'My mind is a blank. I can’t hold a thought in my head right now. ',
  'Ahhhh... So strange. I feel very, very tired. ',
  'Ahhhhh! And I lost! This is not my day. ',
  'Ahhhhhhhhh! Yes, that hits the spot! This is why I can’t give up Pokémon. ',
  'All I learn in my lessons is the conventional way of battling, which doesn’t seem useful in actual battles. ',
  'All I want is to work hard, save my money, and live a quiet life. ',
  'All Mom and Dad do is fiddle with their tablets! They never play with me! I’m bored! ',
  'All Mom and Dad do is mumble at their computers! It’s no fun! ',
  'All right then. Let’s all be good little children and start our Pokémon lesson, shall we? ',
  'All right! Here I come! I’ll show you my power! ',
  'All right! Let’s go! ',
  'All right, then. I’ll watch you. Let your passions run wild!',
  'If you describe it as art, you can fool people into spending money on some little brat’s scribbles. ',
  'All you have to do is ignore reality, and you can stay young forever, too.',
  'Fairy... I’m scared... Help... Help me... ',
  'Always workin’ me to the bone, like I ain’t even worth their time of day or nuttin’!',
  'Despite my appearance, I was an Ace Trainer until recently. ',
  'Amazin’! I got schooled from here to Hoenn! You gotta take me under your wing, boss! ',
  'An airplane that soars across the sky, leaving trails of jet stream behind it... That is how I fly!',
  'I put up with a long, long, long, long, long, long, long flight to get here... ',
  'And I’m terrible at Pokémon battles, too! Now I’m never gonna get a girlfriend...',
  'There are only so many places you can skate, anyway. Honestly, they’re not useful for getting around. ',
  'And, well, I suppose that when I’m older... This kind of getup will be too much hassle!',
  'Don’t you think old ladies look super cute in furisode? ',
  'Anyone can stay young if they keep stars in their eyes and dreams in their hearts!',
  'I can hear a fairy’s voice... It’s telling me not to slip up with you... ',
  'Appearing, battling, then disappearing again... It’s not like I was born just to play this bit part!',
  'To be called a Beauty forever... That is my mission in life... ',
  'Are you gonna pick on me? ',
  'Are you lost here? Are you lost here? Brother John, Brother John.',
  'What’s that? I look bored? That’s because this is a company trip. ',
  'Are you my opponent? You look kind of hungry. ',
  'Are you ready? I’m taking my gloves off.',
  '“Go easy on me” is not in my vocabulary. ',
  'Are you supposed to be my new overlord? What! Is this really OK?! ',
  'Are you sure you’re normal? What in the world do you eat? ',
  'Are your preparations complete? I would like to ask you for a battle.',
  'Very well then, I shall take the liberty of determining whether or not you possess the qualifications befitting a master. ',
  'Aren’t I good for a guy who just battles during his lunch breaks? ',
  'Argh! I hate being so sure all of the time! I don’t want to be a Monsieur!',
  'Argh! Arrgh! ',
  'Argh... I’m so hungry... Can you please spare something... ',
  'Arghh! You! You’ll regret this! I will bring you down someday!',
  'Ugh! Ug-ugh! ',
  'Arghhh! You little—! That HURTS. But, well, that’s how it goes, yeah? ',
  'As a top Breeder, I’ll be using Pokémon with a certified pedigree. ',
  'As long as it tastes good, that’s enough. Don’t sweat the details. ',
  'As times change, values also change. I realized that too late.',
  'Ahh... I’m flat broke... That’s it. I’ve got nothing left... ',
  'As you can see, I’m a bad guy, and that’s why I fight dirty! ',
  'At least I cannot lose when it comes to BMI! ',
  'Aw, sh-shucks!',
  'I won’t lose next time! Let’s battle again sometime! ',
  'Awful! That was an awful performance! I refuse to accept a battle ending like this! ',
  'Aww... I cannot believe I lost! Who are you?!',
  'Even if I give it my all, it’s meaningless when I lose. ',
  'Awww, s-sniff! I losted on my battle... It’s sad, but I s’pose it’s my fault. ',
  'B-b-bonjour, Dresseur! B-battle, s’il vous plaît!',
  'No need to waste time saying hello. Bring it on whenever you’re ready! ',
  'Bah! If I could do a regular job, I’d quit this stinking art in a second.',
  'My way of doing things is to put ridiculous prices on my shoddy paintings. ',
  'Bah! Is that the best you can do? I expected more from you... ',
  'Battles are way more exciting than any party. ',
  'Before I knew it, I’d been here for ages. But I’m not lonesome. Of...of course not.',
  'Whoa, for reals? Did I, like, lose for reals?! Whoa, life. Like, life is woe. ',
  'Before I start searching for my real self... Where in the world are we here? ',
  'Being a Garçon is my disguise, and it helps me live a quiet life.',
  'I’m going to save up my allowance, and then someday I’ll take a trip around the world. ',
  'Being bossed around is crazy annoying, right? That’s one area where Pokémon are really great. ',
  'Being called a Beauty doesn’t excite me at all. It just seems like cheap flattery. ',
  'Being defeated by you makes this waking world seem even less believable than my dreams...',
  'My Fairy says that you’re crazy dangerous! ',
  'Being popular is simple. I like life to be simple. ',
  'Bit of a Pokémon read and write, Trainer, many clinks! ',
  'Blast it all! And it’s all mah own fault! I’ve gotta apologize to mah sweet Pokémon!',
  'I looked cool throwing my Poké Ball. But I got distracted, so I lost. ',
  'Blast!',
  'I told you to catch me, didn’t I? You threw me back! Why did you throw me back?! ',
  'Bon sang! What spice! What kick you have! You must tell me your secret ingredient! ',
  'Booooo! Come on, Pokémon! Try harder! ',
  'Both my mom and my dad are Ace Trainers. I’m probably an Ace, too! ',
  'Br-bring it on! Bearing in mind that I’m a b-beginner! ',
  'Breathe deeply of my perfume before you go. Get a whiff of a real Beauty’s aroma!',
  'My friends and I are part of an event where we try to escape from here! ',
  'But I guess that this and that are two totally different things, huh?',
  'You’re awful... Everyone is awful... Why won’t people judge me by what’s inside? ',
  'But I’m still not cool even though I’ve been recognized as an Ace...',
  'In the end, being good at battling alone isn’t enough, no matter how strong you are. ',
  'But wait—doesn’t that mean wearing white makes it clear you’ve got something to hide?',
  'Now that the battle’s over, I will again be afflicted by the same old tedium. ',
  'Bwahaha! You’ll win, too, if you just up your calorie intake a bit! ',
  'Bwahahahah! My Pokémon’s ninja skills are without equal!',
  'I’ll bet that turned your hair white! ',
  'By putting yourself into a corner, you draw out your full potential!',
  'Hahaha... It just feels so good... I want to keep on skating like this forever... ',
  'Certain types of people use sweet talk no matter what you look like. It’s meaningless. ',
  'Change! It’s time for a change! I couldn’t take that kind of job a single day longer!',
  'Where can I find a new boss? Somebody please hire me! ',
  'Cheers, all you Poké Fans out there! May the Poké Fan last forever! ',
  'Chosen Trainers will choose chosen Pokémon. ',
  'Close my eyes... Sharpen my senses... I have to trust my instincts... ',
  'Come on, let’s get on with it already! I can’t stand it when it’s not popping! ',
  'Come on, let’s get on with it already! No need to worry about particulars! ',
  'Come. I will give you a taste of a Veteran’s well-trained Pokémon.',
  'Before I knew it, I was being treated like a senior citizen. Time goes by too quickly... ',
  'Come. Sleep quietly in my arms...',
  'How about it? We’re awesome, right? You were able to explode, weren’t you? ',
  'Could it be... How... My Pokémon and I are the strongest, though... ',
  'C’mon, pal. I’m just a newbie over here. You’re gonna take it easy on me, right?',
  'I just finished my introductory training. Please battle me! ',
  'C’mon, prey! You’ve gotta struggle a bit more, or it’s not any fun for me!',
  'As long as there are Trainers, the banquet will continue for all eternity. ',
  'Da Preschooler lost! Tank you anyways! ',
  'Daddy gave me my Pokémon! They’ve gotta be the strongest! ',
  'Dance, blossom, and bloom! This woman flowers in triumph! ',
  'Dedicating yourself completely to something can cause loneliness.',
  'Those with overwhelming abilities can welcome loneliness at times. ',
  'Defeat is not a dish on my bill of fare! ',
  'Defeat is worth nothing. Losers don’t need words...',
  'Because I’m a greenhorn, I’m not worth mentioning. ',
  'Despite my appearance, I was born a city boy. I yearned for country life.',
  'Despite my appearance, I was born a country boy. So I yearned for city life. ',
  'Did I underestimate you? Or was it your true ability that let you win?',
  'Oh! You did pretty well, didn’t you? You’re better than I thought! ',
  'Did you enjoy the battle with me? ',
  'Did you think you could beat me with such wimpy Pokémon?',
  'Did you think I would be satisfied with such tiny Pokémon? ',
  'Didn’t you come here for a Pokémon battle?',
  'Ain’t you dat Champion? Lessee what you got! ',
  'Ditching his new bride like this... He...he can’t possibly be getting cold feet now?!',
  'By the time I realized what was happening, I was lounging on a hotel bed. I know it’s wrong, but I can’t stop. ',
  'Do not mistake the means for the goal. That is what my master once taught me.',
  'Hnnph... You’re just some brat... What do you think I am?! ',
  'Do you have a nice small hometown? If so, you should go back and visit there.',
  'You don’t go visit your hometown, do you? City life must be nice. ',
  'Do you intend to challenge me, a director of the Pokémon Fan Club? ',
  'Do you think Pokémon research projects need any test subjects?',
  'I guess the talent you’re born with really does decide battles... ',
  'Does your face still look like that? You won’t be doing any winning like that. ',
  'Doesn’t a traditional restaurant sound groovy? I can almost hear the quiet murmur of voices... ',
  'Don’t be nervous—leave it to me. If it’s technique we’re talking about, I’m confident. ',
  'Don’t be scared, or you will never win.',
  'Hohoho. Dat’s it, huh? Even the Champion ain’t nothin’ special. ',
  'Don’t get mad over something like this. There are things in the world more worthy of anger.',
  'Aww... If only you could have saved some strength for the last spurt of effort... ',
  'Don’t let your guard down, or you may be crying when a kid beats you. ',
  'Don’t these kind of guided tours make you feel like you’re really not used to traveling?',
  'What? This isn’t a battle appreciation tour, but a battle participation tour?! ',
  'Don’t underestimate me because I am old. I’ll show you my rejuvenating attack!',
  'My treasured Pokémon and I have been together for a long time. No need to go easy on us. ',
  'Don’t you call me a Veteran! A woman is always young at heart!',
  'Maybe it’s because they respect me, but everyone calls me a Veteran. ',
  'Don’t you think a restaurant for Pokémon is a fun idea?',
  'I work at a restaurant where people come on dates a lot, so it’s really stressful. ',
  'Don’t you think it’s a bit too much? This kimono? But, well, I can only pull it off while I’m still young.',
  'The only people who can pull off furisode are flashy girls and old ladies, right? ',
  'Don’t you worry your silly widdle head! I’ll take away ALL your pain, mmkay?',
  'Talking is not my thing, and the battle’s over, so I’m going home. ',
  'Dreams are important! Desires are important!',
  'I’m completely invincible! My legend begins here! ',
  'D’ya, uh, know where my little lady is? Seems like she’s gone up and missing...',
  'Pardon me, but may I ask to use your facilities? ',
  'Eeeeek!',
  'My hypnotic powers don’t work on you?! What mental fortitude you must possess! ',
  'Eek! I should’ve stayed in my room with my PC! ',
  'Ehhh, off with you! If you don’t, I’m gonna make you listen to me gush about my husband all night!',
  'I like my husband for not prying into my past, trying to find out what I used to be like. ',
  'Enough already! I just want to go home! I miss my mother!',
  'All right! I’m on my way now! My battle begins here! ',
  'Enough... That’s enough...',
  'I’m a professional punching bag, so all that matters is that you’re pleased with your victory. ',
  'Even difficult, trying experiences have their purpose, I suppose. ',
  'Even if I lose, I can just jump in my time machine and go back to the past to try a battle again!',
  'This tour’s supposed to come with Pokémon battles, but it’s just making me tired! ',
  'Even if I try to forget, I can’t remember... That’s probably all I need to know, isn’t it? ',
  'Even if it’s tough, even if it’s painful, I’mma do it! I’m a Trainer, dagnabbit!',
  'How should I hold my arm when I throw a Poké Ball? Is it like this? Or maybe like this? ',
  'Even if you win, you will hurt your opponent’s feelings.',
  'It’s that I am a very strong Trainer! ',
  'Even my own family disowned me. As long as I have Pokémon, that’s OK, though. ',
  'Even now, as long as I keep coming here, I’m missing out on other things. ',
  'Even though I lost, I’ll be fine. Best of luck, Trainer! ',
  'Even your strength is just as my master’s was! P-please! Allow me to serve at your side!',
  'I’m doing this for my boss’s sake. What do you think I am? ',
  'Every time a Pokémon uses a move, my heart trembles!',
  'Aha, your confidence shows. You must have good Pokémon. ',
  'Every time I travel, I find myself thinking the same thing. Do you know what it is?',
  'What I look forward to when I travel is catching Pokémon at my destination. ',
  'Everybody has a different dream. I just want to have a normal life. ',
  'Everybody paid more attention to me when I pretended to be rich. ',
  'Everyone should just disappear! I don’t need anyone but Pokémon!',
  'If there are still dreams in your heart, then I am still a Fairy Tale Girl. ',
  'Everything feels clearer when you get this excited! I can’t stop this dangerous game!',
  'Battles make you feel good, too. Maybe that’s also the work of endorphins. ',
  'Everything is about what SHE wants to do... Exactly what part of this is “our” honeymoon, huh?',
  'All the other people on this tour are old. There’s no way I’ll find anyone. ',
  'Eww, don’t tell me this is one of THOSE regions. You expect me to tip the plebs?',
  'I want to go home already... I’ve had enough of traveling... ',
  'Excuse me! Would you keep your distance! What if you got my precious kimono dirty?!',
  'Our uniforms are furisode, so I get embarrassed when I have to go outside to pick something up. ',
  'Experience hardships when you’re still young. Old bodies just can’t take them.',
  'With the tears that pour onto my palette, I shall paint the self-portrait of a loser. ',
  'Fair and square? Don’t make me laugh! There’s no point to battles if you don’t win! ',
  'Fair play? What’re you talking about? Is that some kind of loser thing?',
  'All right! Can I be one, too? An Ace Trainer... ',
  'Farewell, hearth and home and all I know! I shall become a Tourist!',
  'They say that battling local Trainers is part of what makes traveling memorable. ',
  'Father... Mother... Did you see? I won a battle... I really won! ',
  'Father... Mother... Watch over my battle... ',
  'Father... Mother... What should I do? ',
  'Feh! I will at least admit that you have a skill for feigning strength.',
  'I’ve been inspired by our battle! I’ve suddenly thought of a new dish! ',
  'Finally, someone has climbed the mountain! This is my summit!',
  'Go! You’ve gotta go! Go on and leave me! ',
  'Finally, they calmed down... You’ve saved me. Thank you! ',
  'Five seconds. You got that? I’m gonna wipe the floor with you in five seconds.',
  'My strategy is to deceive my opponents with my speed. ',
  'Fool! Oh no, there I go again... ',
  'Fooooo!',
  'Now you’re under my spell. You’re like a puppet under my command. ',
  'For my Pokémon to not even stand a chance, you must be quite the technician! ',
  'For the sake of your future, think about how you interact with your elders. ',
  'For you to defeat me like this... What is the goal you strive for?',
  'No way... Maybe I was taking you too lightly. ',
  'From now on, I am your employer. ',
  'Gals of Kalos don’t take it on the chin... Ooh, ooh, ooh, you’ll regret this win... ',
  'Game on, Pokémon! Give it all you’ve got! ',
  'Gasp! What maliciousness was in that move?! I see. So you must also be a ninja...',
  'The fruits of my victory... have already been harvested... ',
  'Getting older is a one-way ticket. I regret nothing! ',
  'Glad you made it! It won’t be an easy job from here. ',
  'Glory...to the... Pokémon...Fan Club... ',
  'Go, my precious Pokémon! To battle! Rush the enemy! ',
  'Good-bye! You’ve been beaten by a Rich Boy! ',
  'Grip and rip, baby! I’m going to capture every moment of this trip for posterity!',
  'Grip and rip, baby! I’m going to keep shooting even if I use up all my film! ',
  'Grrr... My victory has disappeared down into some dark crevasse... ',
  'Grumble, grumble... Huh? Did I win? ',
  'Grumble, grumble... Oh? Was that it? ',
  'Grumble, grumble... ',
  'Gwahaha... I can’t get enough of the feeling of superiority when looking down on a loser... ',
  'Gwahahaha! How about that?! Didja see that?! My partner’s rough and tough! ',
  'Ha ha! Now I can consume some more calories... ',
  'Ha! That was just the power I was hoping for! We’re similar—no, just the same, you and I! ',
  'Hah... Hah... All that skating... It really took it...out of me...',
  'Won’t they stink since they’ve been on my feet this whole time? I even wear them in the bath! ',
  'Hah... Hah... No, not yet! I still need more inspiration!',
  'There’s these people called curators who take most of my money, so it’s like I’m not making any money. ',
  'Haha! What’d I tell ya? You’re not ready yet. ',
  'Haha... I probably did not have to use my strongest kick on you.',
  'You didn’t decide quickly enough, so you got a little from column A and a little from column B. ',
  'Hahaha! I am as big as my backpack, aren’t I? Aren’t I?',
  'If I can just live here and play all day, I’ll never need to struggle. ',
  'Hahaha! I am the summit, and the road to reach me is still very steep!',
  'Even if you run into me disastrously, there’s no rescue team on its way! ',
  'Halt at once! You there! Let us cross lances!',
  'Pokémon battle is not a sport or a hobby. Get out of here if all you want is to play! ',
  'Halt, fool! I am the guardian of this castle’s gardens! A ninja of nature!',
  'Hey! If you’re not considerate to your elders, you’ll be pulled out by the roots! ',
  'Har har har! You were scared of me! My new look is a big success! ',
  'Harooo!',
  'Time for a battle haiku! I knew I would win. Yes, my Pokémon and I are really this strong. ',
  'Harrumph! Harooo!',
  'Time for a battle haiku! This is really good. My opponent is a kid. I will win for sure. ',
  'Harrumph!!',
  'Time for a battle haiku! I can’t believe it. I can still continue on. I can still battle. ',
  'Harrumph. I’m still weak. I pity my Pokémon... ',
  'Have we met or not? I don’t really remember. Well, I guess it’s nice to meet you anyway! ',
  'Have you got any more to show me? Slurp, slurp. Don’t worry. I won’t splash soup on them! Sluuu-uurp! ',
  'Having carte blanche only leads to disaster. No, I was never well suited to be an Owner.',
  'Even as old as I am, I just can’t give up Pokémon battles. ',
  'Haw haw haw... I’ll show you how hawesome my Pokémon are! ',
  'Healing sites are nice, too, but they can’t hold a candle to haunted sites!',
  'Terrible! You aren’t holding enough grudges! If you want to win, put more into your curses! ',
  'Hee hee hee! That was quite the scrabble! Even if you weren’t very good, I still enjoyed it!',
  'Is that all you’ve got? Is that the sum total of the passion you have locked inside you? ',
  'Heehee! If you wanna see some of my art, it’s displayed all over the city!',
  'Just walking around town irritates me. It’s nothing but ugly buildings and low-class billboards. ',
  'Heh-heh-heh. From today on, you are already a Pokémon!',
  'You... Are you so weak as to reverse my prophecy? ',
  'Heh-heh-heh. If you lose, I’ll turn you into a Pokémon.',
  'I shall make a prophecy... This battle... You will emerge victorious... ',
  'Heh. You can’t do battle if you’re afraid of losing. ',
  'Heh... I regret nothing... It was a fight worth my family’s honor...',
  'I came here to crush impudent Trainers. ',
  'Hehe! Mehehehehe! See? It’s fun to win! ',
  'Heheh. Exactly as I planned... There’s no way I would lose. ',
  'Heheh... I see it all clearly... You are a doctor from an evil planet, aren’t you?',
  'Heh... Welcome back... I haven’t forgotten your face... ',
  'Heheheh... Are you sure? Don’t you think you could keep going?',
  'Can you trust your own eyes? Do you know what’s important to you? ',
  'Hello, me old china, time for the rhyma! ',
  'Here I am, a master of the universe, a mover and shaker of the future! ',
  'Here I go! I battle for the honor of the branch office! ',
  'Here, here! Take my camera, and get a shot of me looking awesome after beating you in battle!',
  'Grip and rip, baby! I’m going to keep shooting even if I’m using up all my film! ',
  'Hey there, Trainer! Do you think I’m a grown-up? ',
  'Hey! Are you for real? I’ll pay you back for treating me like this! ',
  'Hey! Hey! Please check out my cute Pokémon!',
  'If my theory is correct, you’ll lose with the Pokémon you’re about to send out. ',
  'Hey! How dare you do such a thing to a Rich Boy like me! ',
  'Hey! I told you to go easy on me! Still, you’re pretty cool when you’re serious.',
  'I’m actually getting tired of battling... There’s gotta be something new to do... ',
  'Hey! It’s me. It’s me! The Owner of the world!',
  'Hey! It’s me. It’s me! The Owner of the world! ',
  'Hey! This is no laughing matter! We’re about to battle! ',
  'Hey! Welcome! I’ve got some real plump and lively Pokémon right here! ',
  'Hey! Who you starin’ at! You want to scrap? Keep it up and you’ll have one. ',
  'Hey! You! Yeah, you! Let’s work up a good sweat together, right?',
  'I may still be wet behind the ears, but I aim to be a Veteran someday! ',
  'Hey, another out. So what? We’ll come back! We always do! ',
  'Hey, baby! You’re just what I’ve been looking for! I’m not gonna let you get away! ',
  'Hey, can’t you take a hint? I was trying to fake you out!',
  'If you want to make tourists spend money, provide them with a service. ',
  'Hey, don’t be so stuck up! Battles can be left up to fate! ',
  'Hey, don’t sweat it... Sometimes you’ve just gotta learn to let it go.',
  'Soon I’ll be strong and respected enough that everyone will kneel before me! ',
  'Hey, don’t think bad of me, baby! You ran out of luck when you met me. ',
  'Hey, hey! I’m a Rich Boy! Bow to your patron! ',
  'Hey, hey! No crying! I’ve got no time for some kid’s tears! ',
  'Hey, it’s not like I chose for the battle to go this way, all right? Don’t go blaming me.',
  'After a battle, you have to care for your skin within seconds! You have to be careful, too! ',
  'Hey, kid! Are you scared of me? If you’re scared, say you’re scared. ',
  'Hey, now, just a minute there! I haven’t lost this thing yet!',
  'Keep your capabilities in mind as you go on your way. ',
  'Hey, that’s why I’m saying this. How could I end up like this? ',
  'Hey, we just got going! This is where it starts getting good! ',
  'Hey, you! Don’t mess with me, or I will destroy your Pokémon! ',
  'Hey, you, young Trainer. I’m utterly stylish, aren’t I?',
  'Hey now, you’re pretty much in a daze... Of course, I am pretty hunky... ',
  'Hey... Can I ask you a question? When did you start loving your Pokémon? ',
  'Hey... You lost, right? Give me food... Give it to me... ',
  'Hi! Focus!',
  'Look into my eyes. That’s it. Breathe deeply as I count one, two, three... ',
  'Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting! I’m a Hiker with a cult following!',
  'Hi there! I’m a Hiker! ♪ Watch your step! ',
  'Hiding any unpleasant details of my past... Ain’t I just the picture of a perfect wife?',
  'My ex-boyfriend gave me all my Pokémon. I’d feel bad if I let them go after all this time. ',
  'Hitchhiking around the region without a cent to your name has its own charm. ',
  'Hiya, honey! Welcome, welcome! Have you decided what you’ll have?',
  'I have confidence in my Pokémon’s manners. ',
  'Hm, hm, hm! There was no avoiding it! Your Pokémon give off a real aroma of victory!',
  'How could it have turned out like this? Where did my seasoning go wrong?! ',
  'Hmm, do you discipline your Pokémon? Pampering them too much is no good.',
  'You get as much love as you give when you’re dealing with Pokémon... ',
  'Hmm. Have you been eating well? Can’t fight on an empty stomach! ',
  'Hmm... As a Trainer, you are at the level of a Poké Fan.',
  'Yes yes! That was a nice battle! It feels good to lose like that! ',
  'Hmm... As a Trainer, you are at the level of a Preschooler.',
  'Taking it easy on me isn’t very good service! You have no idea how to entertain! ',
  'Hmmph... I’m no match for you... I can’t beat people who are bigger fans than me. ',
  'Hmph! I’m no servant of yours!',
  'I slipped past my master to come play here in secret. ',
  'Hmph! Looks like no tip is necessary. Then I guess this region isn’t all bad.',
  'Trainers keep attacking me... I shouldn’t have come to a place like this... ',
  'Ho ho ho! That was to our liking! We find ourselves quite satisfied!',
  'I wonder if we could have been friends if we had met in a world with no battles... ',
  'Ho there! You are a mountain standing in my way, aren’t ya? ',
  'Ho-hum. This is not good... The experiment was a failure...',
  'Huh huh huh... Somebody let me experiment... ',
  'Hoard your money, then spend it all shopping! We’re making the economy move here, people!',
  'Traveling is fun, but thinking about what souvenirs to buy is a hassle. ',
  'How about that? I’m proud of my Pokémon.',
  'I knew it... My theory was correct. ',
  'How could I lose to such a wimpy move? Gaaahhh, that bugs the snot out of me! ',
  'How did I lose against such a slacker? I can’t believe it!',
  'When you lose, do you go so far as to analyze the reason for your defeat and review your performance? ',
  'How does it feel to lose? Obviously, I wouldn’t know.',
  'That was beginner’s luck, if I do say so myself. ',
  'How many thousands of years has it been... If only I could lose, my journey would end... ',
  'How should we act and react? That is all that matters, isn’t it?',
  'I suppose it could be said that my relationship with my Pokémon is satisfactory for the time being. ',
  'How strange... How could this be... I shouldn’t have been outmuscled. ',
  'How was it? It was fun, right? I knew my technique would win out! ',
  'How were my Pokémon? Powerful, weren’t they? ',
  'How were the Veteran’s Pokémon? Defeat tastes quite bitter, doesn’t it?',
  'It only makes me angry when people compliment me by saying I’m a Veteran. Don’t you get it? ',
  'However hard they battle, they won’t be satisfied. That is a real Trainer, isn’t it?',
  'Of course I’m strong and don’t lose. It’s important that I win gracefully. ',
  'How’s that? Owned, suckah!',
  'How’s that? Owned, sucka! ',
  'Huehuehue... If it’s cash you want, I’ve got some. How about you go and lose this battle for me? ',
  'Huh? I went to the trouble of taking you down, but you didn’t explode like on TV! ',
  'Huhuehuehue... No crying when you lose... ',
  'Humans should be gone from this world! I don’t like anything or anyone but Pokémon!',
  'I’ve decided to ignore reality. I’m a Fairy Tale Girl, after all. ',
  'Hummmm... You are good. You are really pretty good.',
  'Even in defeat, my heart operates normally without rotting or becoming sad. ',
  'I always get the best grades! I aim to be number one in everything! ',
  'I am a branch manager of the Pokémon Fan Club—and I won! ',
  'I am a genius Preschooler! I’m already prepping for college. ',
  'I am a genius. I will control the future of the world!',
  'I am a genius. I was supposed to take control of the world... ',
  'I am a genius... I am not supposed to lose against someone like you...',
  'My experiment failed, so I’m finished in the academic world. ',
  'I am a late bloomer and a crazy bloomer. I’ll bloom and dazzle you! ',
  'I am a loyal servant to beauty. Ugly defeat does not suit me.',
  'You’re always short on time during battle. Just like life! ',
  'I am a nouveau riche celebrity, so I am stingy with my money! ',
  'I am devoting my body and soul to Pokémon battles!',
  'All within my expectations... Nothing to be surprised about... ',
  'I am four years old! I will do my best! Trainer, you should do your best, too!',
  'I know you, Trainer! So you’re the Champion, eh? ',
  'I am no mere Hiker. Call me an alpinist. ',
  'I am not a regular Poké Fan. I am a major mega-Poké Fan! ',
  'I am not just an ordinary Backpacker, ’cause I’m also a newlywed, you see! ',
  'I am right proud of these Pokémon. They’re my friends and my treasures. ',
  'I am so obsessed with Pokémon, my wife is fit to burst with anger!',
  'My old lady done left me... I reckon it’s all my fault... ',
  'I am the great mountain range of your life! Overcome me if you can!',
  'If you want to reach the peak as a Trainer, you’ll have to climb over me! ',
  'I AM the hero! I beat a villain! ',
  'I am the hero! I refuse to lose! ',
  'I am the strongest Backpacker. I have lots of Pokémon in my Bag.',
  'Saying I’m a free spirit sounds good, but really I’m just an unemployed homeless guy! ',
  'I am the top Breeder. I can tame any kind of Pokémon. ',
  'I am very strong. I will never lose. ',
  'I am well broken in. No snags slow down the smooth running of this machine!',
  'Oh no... I won... They’re gonna cut my pay... ',
  'I battled my way through unfairly and dirtily! Thank you all so very much! ',
  'I came here for my big brother who always hides in his room. ',
  'I came here to goof off. I don’t want to cram for the big test... ',
  'I can hear a sobbing voice... The mountains are weeping... ',
  'I can learn a lot from Pokémon battles in this country. ',
  'I can own any Owners, after all. I can’t be defeated that easily.',
  'Hahaha! Thanks for the nourishment! That was a pretty tasty encounter! ',
  'I can really cut loose in Pokémon battles without getting scolded. ',
  'I can see the despair in your eyes. Bring it on!',
  'Huh? Huh? A battle? Time to go all out! ',
  'I cannot drop the habits I learned when I was young. ',
  'I cannot win even with my devotion. What shall I do?!',
  'Looks fade with age anyway. It’s best to have the same values. ',
  'I can’t be defeated yet... I still have to protect all that is pretty in the world...',
  'Maybe I lose because I’m paying more attention to praying than to battling. ',
  'I can’t be like my mom and dad. So I’ve gotta live as a Punk Guy. ',
  'I can’t believe I won! Wait... Did you seriously go easy on me?',
  'Am I supposed to be all, like, “Yay!” when I win? It’s too late to get excited now. ',
  'I can’t drop my luxurious lifestyle just because I’m older. Nothing can stop it. ',
  'I can’t let Pokémon I really love battle. ',
  'I can’t lose now... I don’t want to study anymore! ',
  'I can’t spend all of my time battling with Pokémon, or I could lose my job! ',
  'I can’t tell my new husband now, of course, but the truth is that I used to be a Punk Girl!',
  'My husband has no idea, but a long time ago, I used to be a Punk Girl! ',
  'I collect the random scribbles of Pokémon, then sell ’em as “art.” I’m makin’ a fortune over here!',
  'I like how you look. I could paint your portrait. ',
  'I could never serve you. You’re too weak for me to even consider it. ',
  'I could see myself serving you. You’re quite skilled, and therefore acceptable. ',
  'I could tell you are a strong Trainer! What you see is what you get, right? ',
  'I couldn’t fool you, could I? You do quite well, don’t you? ',
  'I couldn’t possibly live in a country where everything costs so much!',
  'I could live the high life in a country where everything costs so little! ',
  'I dabbled in art like I dabble in Pokémon! Dabbling is what keeps me from the rabble!',
  'Release it now! Release the passion locked inside you! ',
  'I did it again. I won... I’m going to be fired for not providing good-enough service... ',
  'I didn’t choose to be born a woman, OK? I didn’t choose to grow up and be beautiful!',
  'I intend to continue calling myself a Beauty for as long as I can. ',
  'I do menial work every single day. Am I just a cog in the machine?',
  'I’m happy that I’m able to work here. This is truly the job that I was born to do. ',
  'I do not accept any Pokémon that I do not like. ',
  'I do what I want! I live how I please! That’s the way Daddy’s little girl rolls! ',
  'I don’t care who you are or where you come from.',
  'My Pokémon and I will take the liberty of using you to face off against. ',
  'I don’t have a small hometown to go back to, ’cause I was born and raised in the city.',
  'I was born and raised in the country, so the neon lights of the city may be too bright for me. ',
  'I don’t know if they thought I was a Butler or a robot...',
  'If I had known it was going to turn out like this, I wouldn’t have run away from the mansion! ',
  'I don’t like Mom or Dad or their silly computers! All I need are Pokémon! ',
  'I don’t like Mom or Dad or their silly tablets! All I need are Pokémon! ',
  'I don’t mind your lack of focus, but you will get no sympathy from me if you lose. ',
  'I don’t need any memory like this! Who wants to remember their failures? Delete!',
  'I really feel like I’m traveling every time the shutter snaps! ',
  'I don’t need memories like this. Deleting memory... ',
  'I don’t want to go home, ’cause my wife is as scary as a Legendary Pokémon.',
  'I got too hooked on Pokémon battles, so’s I never did nothin’ around the house. ',
  'I envy Pokémon, ’cause they’re so carefree. I want to be a Pokémon.',
  'I can have lazy battles like this, but I can’t hold down a square job. ',
  'I expected nothing less from my overlord! It would be worthwhile to serve you! ',
  'I feel like crying in frustration, but I do thank you very much. ',
  'I feel sad whenever I see a bright, young child like you.',
  'I don’t care for children. They’re noisy and selfish. ',
  'I got a little carried away earlier, but what job was I talking about? ',
  'I guess I slipped up there... You did pretty good, baby. ',
  'I guess it’s more important to ask how long you’ll keep loving them, though, isn’t it? ',
  'I guess I’m happier than a person who cannot even be a cog in the machine.',
  'My job is to let people win. It’s all right. No problems here. ',
  'I guess we can stop training for today. You learned some new things, right? ',
  'I had no plans for the weekend, so I ended up wandering here before I knew what I was about.',
  'For reals? Like, a battle for reals? Whoa, crazy! Like, too crazy! ',
  'I hate the happiness of others... I’m just that sort of person, OK?',
  'I just want to be left alone. Dealing with people is such a bother... ',
  'I hate to say this, but if you can’t even beat me, the rest of the way is going to be really tough. ',
  'I have a gluttonous Pokémon that’s destroying my budget. No joke! ',
  'I have a special method that I use to nurture my Pokémon. ',
  'I have a strict policy about my hairstyle. It’s my whole life, so I get really fired up about it. ',
  'I have devoted my life to Pokémon. I see things differently than you do.',
  'The most important thing in a marriage is having shared interests, after all. ',
  'I have made them too strong. They are beyond my control... ',
  'I have more money than I know what to do with. There’s nothing I really want. ',
  'I have more Pokémon in my Bag! Oh... Wait... My Bag has a hole...',
  'Dreaming about being free is the best part... ',
  'I have no idea what the natural flavors of my Pokémon are. ',
  'I have pains in my eyes, my shoulder, and my back, but my heart is forever young.',
  'I’m not grown up enough to be happy about being called a Veteran... ',
  'I have raised these very special Pokémon using a special method.',
  'The secret to my Pokémon’s strength is their specially blended food. ',
  'I have to spoil my Pokémon to say thanks for winning. ',
  'I have trained my Pokémon well, and it’s ready to go to the job site.',
  'In the end, you have to go at your own pace. You can’t help but be influenced by others. ',
  'I have very low self-esteem, so I like having someone else give me orders.',
  'Being a Maid is just a part-time gig. I’m really a Battle Girl! ',
  'I have won.',
  'I may have won this time, but I wonder how many more times I’ll be able to throw a Poké Ball... ',
  'I hope the distance between us gets a little closer during this battle. ',
  'I hope you’ll find something you can be serious about. ',
  'I inherited this big-boned body from my parents... I’m like a living mountain range... ',
  'I just battle for fun, but I’ll do my best. ',
  'I just can’t stop these blasted nosebleeds! Every time I get excited or nervous... Argh!',
  'Yes! Battling when in one’s best condition is one of the basics of being a Trainer! ',
  'I just want a boyfriend! No, not just any boyfriend— I want a silly boyfriend I can be lovey-dovey with!',
  'Fine... Maybe I’ll change my tune from Punk Girl to surfer girl. Now, look out! ',
  'I just want to be successful and grow rich someday.',
  'My dream is to be rich and live in the lap of luxury. ',
  'I just win all my Pokémon battles, too. I feel like my life is already over. ',
  'I just...wanted to... stuff myself...one...last...time. ',
  'I know your face. You think you can battle like that? ',
  'I leave my beloved family behind in my hometown and set out upon my lonely journey of a lifetime!',
  'I didn’t need to make any memories like this, local boy/girl. ',
  'I lied when I said I didn’t feel well! Veterans will do anything to win!',
  'Umm, is my daughter watching? I did it! Daddy did it! ',
  'I lost a lot of things because I love Pokémon too much...',
  'My husband may not be much to look at, but his love of Pokémon is what drew me to him. ',
  'I lost against a kid, Bro... I should’ve listened to you...',
  'My bad... Bro... I should’ve listened to my bro... ',
  'I lost, but I won’t give you my lunch money! ',
  'I love Pokémon... I love, love, love Pokémon! ',
  'I love your Pokémon, too! Please, let me pet them! ',
  'I may be a Chef, but I have no interest in my own dishes. ',
  'I may be a Maid, but that doesn’t mean that I can serve just anybody. ',
  'I may be bad and stupid, but I’m serious about Pokémon. ',
  'I may be bad, but I got nothin’ but love for my Pokémon. ',
  'I may be getting on in years, but I’m a self-proclaimed globe-trotting adventurer! ',
  'I may be incompetent, having been born only recently, but I’ll take the liberty of battling you as best I can. ',
  'I may be young, but that doesn’t mean I’ll lose—even to a grown-up. ',
  'I may have said I had cash, but I haven’t said anything about giving you any! ',
  'I may look like this now, but I was once a Beauty, too, you know!',
  'I get stronger by dwelling on the past. That’s the way I’ve lived my life, after all. ',
  'I must do my best to learn even more about Pokémon.',
  'This result is impossible... I am my father’s son, after all. ',
  'I normally only ever listen to classical music, but if I lose, I think I shall try a bit of new age!',
  'I grow stronger with each tear I cry. ',
  'I only really feel at peace when I’m with Pokémon. ',
  'I paint pictures and live with Pokémon. I’m enjoying my life!',
  'Grabbing a Poké Ball for a battle you know you can’t win is called being a Trainer. ',
  'I pledge myself now to the great roller spirits! My love, my hopes, my vow... It’s all for you!',
  'People call me the “electrastic” Trainer! Think you can keep up with me? ',
  'I praise your courage in challenging me! For I am the one with the strongest kick!',
  'Oh, I see. Would you like to be cut to pieces? Or do you prefer the role of punching bag? ',
  'I really don’t want my skin to burn, so I want to stay in the shade while I work. ',
  'I really feel blah... I think I’ll go home. ',
  'I really let myself get carried away this time. I hope it doesn’t affect my future prospects. ',
  'I shall present to you elegant moves worthy of the title of Rich Boy! ',
  'I smell a person of exceptional courage. Ho! I’m looking forward to this! ',
  'I started battling just to be cool, but I became an Ace before I knew it.',
  'Even if people call you an Ace Trainer, it’s not like you get anything special for it. ',
  'I started skating because I’d heard that girls liked guys who skate. It’s not working at all.',
  'Honestly, these are inconvenient and hard to walk in. Roller Skates are not suited for getting around. ',
  'I started this job because it pays well, but I’ve just about reached my limit! ',
  'I still feel kind of blah. I’m all achy... ',
  'I sure would like to do the fighting instead of my Pokémon, if I could.',
  'Let’s have a fun battle! No hard feelings, no matter if we win or lose! ♪ ',
  'I think I am a Poké Fan, therefore I am a Poké Fan. ',
  'I think life’s OK as long as you get back more than you lose. ',
  'I thought you were a child. Hee hee... You are tough...',
  'Humph... Look at how you look! At your age, you should respect the rules. ',
  'I took this job because I wanted to see smiles on people’s faces. ',
  'I turn 44 this year, but I have no intention of going out into the world until I’ve gone around the world. ',
  'I used my money to acquire my Pokémon. This is the power of being an adult. ',
  'I used to be popular, but now I am all washed up.',
  'My Pokémon will trump yours! You can bet on losing! ',
  'I used to get two minutes of sleep per day. Being a Butler was one hard job.',
  'I am a Butler no more! I’m now just another unemployed old geezer! ',
  'I want to be a Pokémon researcher when I grow up.',
  'My dad is a Veteran Trainer, so I should have what it takes, too. ',
  'I want to be a real Ace like my mom and dad. ',
  'I want to fall while still in bloom, rather than dying on the branch. ',
  'I want to get to the point where I can feel good about the way I live my life. ',
  'I want to melt right into that blurry scenery that you can only see when going so fast.',
  'Roller Skates are expensive, and then you have to deal with the maintenance. It’s tough. ',
  'I want to play here forever without being tied down. ',
  'I was able to throw my Poké Ball this time! It usually just rolls out of my hand... ',
  'I was born rich and I party all the time. I’m what you call party people. ',
  'I was born to do battle, ya hear?! I’m a darn tootin’ Trainer! I am!',
  'Apparently battles go better when you throw your Poké Ball in the right way. ',
  'I was born, raised, and live in the mountains. I’m an Ace Hiker, I tells ya. ',
  'I was overwhelmed by success. I took it for granted, and I didn’t work hard.',
  'All right! Victory is mine! Fortune is smiling on me! ',
  'I was so innocent back then... Where has that girl gone? ',
  'I was utterly inexperienced. I’d be  grateful if I could be your pupil.',
  'Doing too much of anything will wreck your body. Everything in moderation, OK? ',
  'I will be rich someday and put you to shame.',
  'When I’m a big, important man, I’ll make you regret this. ',
  'I will evaluate your ability.',
  'I’d like to have a pleasant battle! Provide me with that service! ',
  'I will go my way because I don’t have any other way. ',
  'I will keep winning and winning and winning... I will be number one! ',
  'I will make you cry, ’cause you just don’t know when to quit.',
  'My 88 years of living have led me to this conclusion: Victory shall be my only art! ',
  'I will test the Pokémon you have been training. ',
  'I wish I could live in the worlds that I see in games, anime, and comics.',
  'Whoa, that was a close one. I almost got my clothes dirty. ',
  'I wish my big brother would come out of his room and play with me... ',
  'I wish my son were as mature as you are.',
  'Now if only my son would get himself together, then I’d really be free! ',
  'I wish they would talk to me instead of their computers... ',
  'I won again... My journey still isn’t over... ',
  'I won the battle. But victory is nothing compared to the vastness of nature...',
  'I’m sure how you feel is not so bad if you compare it to my anxiety attacks... ',
  'I won, but I was so scared... Maybe I’m not cut out for this. ',
  'I wonder if I could become a Pokémon if I had a Trainer... ',
  'I wonder if my mom and dad will be sad if they see that I’ve become a Punk Guy. ',
  'I wonder if people will order a full-course meal for Pokémon.',
  'Oh, I feel refreshed! There’s nothing like a good battle to perk you up! ',
  'I won’t be going easy on you just because you’re a kid. Bring it on! ',
  'I won’t cry... I won’t. Someday, I will win. ',
  'I won’t get mad if you beat me. It’s just a game, after all!',
  'The problem is knowing whether to put your full force into the starting dash or the last spurt of effort. ',
  'I won’t lose against a kid like you who doesn’t know anything about battles.',
  'All right then, throw your Poké Ball! I’ll catch it right away! ',
  'I won’t stop! Well, I can’t stop! Hey, that’s just the way I roll!',
  'They’re really popular now, so everyone will shun me if I don’t at least look like I’m wearing Roller Skates. ',
  'I won’t tell you how old I really am, but I can say I’m old enough to be your mother!',
  'Thank you, fairy... I was about to be in trouble... ',
  'I would like to retire soon...but I have no one to carry on the family business...',
  'My husband passed before me, so I’m finally free to live the life I want! ',
  'I would never just skate by in battle! Even if I am wearing Roller Skates!',
  'I would never just skate by in battle! Even if I am wearing Roller Skates! ',
  'I, the great Dariole, fear nothing under the sky!',
  'As a result of throwing Poké Balls, we are well trained in how to handle pans. ',
  'I-I can’t even skate by anymore? That’s it... I’m done. I’m retiring.',
  'I guess I can’t just skate by anymore... Even if I am wearing Roller Skates. ',
  'I-I give up my seat as Emperor of Eating... Take care of my precious land of feasting... ',
  'I-I’ve got a husband... No, really, I do... Because this is my honeymoon...see?',
  'Traveling alone is the best... After all, I’m all alone... ',
  'I...I’m sorry. I just wanted to show you my friends... ',
  'I...wanted to eat...until I’m stuffed... one...last...time... ',
  'If all you have is passable ingredients, you can’t do better than passable battles. ',
  'If I lose at such an early stage, I can’t be number one... ',
  'If it’s cute, fluffy Pokémon you want, leave it to me!',
  'Uhnn... What is this place? It doesn’t have the aroma of a fairy tale at all! ',
  'If I’d had a child like you, my golden years would have been carefree...',
  'When I got older I realized how lovely it is to be alone. ',
  'If I’d only known that when I was young, I wouldn’t be having such a hard time now... ',
  'If only there were a machine that would throw Poké Balls for me... ',
  'If villains disturb the natural order, I will put them in jail!',
  'Being surrounded by nature seems good for your health and your looks, doesn’t it? ',
  'If you believe you can win, you should be able to. If you think you’ll lose, you probably will. ',
  'If you don’t have great Pokémon, you’ll never have a great battle. ',
  'If you don’t know me, you’re bogus! Good-bye! The Worker is heading out.',
  'That wasn’t a bad attempt, but I warned you I’d be tough! ',
  'If you don’t work, you can’t shop till you drop! I work hard so I can waste my money like this!',
  'I mean, it costs money, so I wish the custom of giving souvenirs would go away. ',
  'If you join the Pokémon Fan Club, your life will be saved! ',
  'If you join the Pokémon Fan Club, you’ll be strong, like me! ',
  'If you like what you do as a job, you have a sense of fulfillment, don’t you?',
  'It was fun even though I lost, but it worries me that I’m not disappointed at all. ',
  'If you lose, I’ll have you help me with my latest experiment!',
  'You don’t want to hear about Pokémon from people who know nothing about Pokémon, do you? ',
  'If you lose, you can be my servant. ',
  'If you lose, you may resent your opponent.',
  'It’s that I am a very weak Trainer... ',
  'If you understand the meaning of what I’m saying, then why are you here? ',
  'If you want to be even stronger, you should get amazing punk hair, too!  ',
  'If you want to dream big, then you’ll need to build up a whole lot of experience in battle!',
  'You might make it there before me. To the other side of Pokémon Battles... ',
  'If you want to make your dreams reality, then you have to be completely dedicated! ',
  'If you want to win, ze whining, it will not help! Neizer will ze wurst, I’m afraid...',
  'You understand zese words I say to you in ze battle, no? ',
  'If you work diligently, you will get results.',
  'Thanks for coming all this way! I’m sorry I don’t have much to offer, but do make yourself comfortable. ',
  'If you’re already losing, maybe it’d be better to turn back now. ',
  'In a cemetery where the party begins after the day ends. Yes, that’s the life for me...',
  'Defeating me is amazing! You must be kinda cursed, too! ',
  'In accordance with the rules of unsportsmanship, my pledge is to play dirty and battle unfairly! ',
  'In cooking and battling, just go for it and don’t sweat the small stuff. ',
  'In my country, we say that white can hide all manner of sins. Isn’t it great?',
  'Throwing Poké Balls to while away your tedious hours can make you stronger. ',
  'In order to become a first-class Trainer, I was forced to come study abroad here. ',
  'In the end, this world is all about money. Even these Pokémon... ',
  'In the land of feasting, I am king! Nay, I am the Emperor of Eating! ',
  'In the words of an ancient warrior, “Conquer the self, and you will conquer the opponent.”',
  'Th-this is my first real battle... M-my legs feel weak... ',
  'Inaction doesn’t mean do nothing! Did you hug an Electrode with the Static Ability or something?',
  'Hunnh... Not bad... You’ve got a surreal side... ',
  'Inaction may be the rage for art, but maybe it’s not such a great strategy for battling...',
  'Hunnh... Not bad... You’ve got a realistic side... ',
  'Indeed! This is my moment of takeoff! I’m taking off from you! Eat my dust!',
  'I’m sleepy... So sleepy... ',
  'Indeed, you and your Pokémon have strength to spare. I like you. ',
  'Inspiration... I need inspiration... Someone, please, inspire me!',
  'People have started calling me an up-and-coming artist, but it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. ',
  'Is it really OK? Do you really think someone like me can be a Trainer?',
  'Wait! Wait! I’m still trying to think up my strategy! ',
  'Is this the dawning of the age of Aquarius?',
  'Now I can get even stronger. I grow with every grudge. ',
  'Isn’t that nice... You’re still a kid... I wish I could go back... ',
  'It bothers me that people always misunderstand me. I’m a lot more pure than everyone thinks. ',
  'It doesn’t matter at all who wins or loses a game. The one who had fun is the real winner.',
  'All right! The starting dash decided our battle! ',
  'It doesn’t matter to the vastness of nature whether I win or lose...',
  'Something like this is pretty trivial compared to the stifling feelings of city life. ',
  'It feels good to be popular, but sometimes I feel achingly empty. ',
  'It is important to nurture and train each Pokémon’s characteristics.',
  'Unlike my diabolical self, these are some good Pokémon. ',
  'It is only right to be who and what you are. Do not fight it. Just leave yourself in fate’s hands.',
  'I’m a Gardener, but maybe I’ll try to become the Champion. ',
  'It looks like I didn’t properly appreciate how great my own Pokémon could have been... ',
  'It may be a hard truth for a child to accept, but money does make the world go round. ',
  'It seems I have been chosen to lose... ',
  'It seems like you don’t even understand how great your Pokémon could be. ',
  'It seems that my studies have paid off. Could this be my actual ability level? ',
  'It takes money to open your own restaurant. That’s why I do all these little part-time jobs. ',
  'It was a mistake to challenge me if you’re not that much of a fan. ',
  'It was a waste of time, much as I suspected. You should consider starting over from zero.',
  'Terrible! You’re extremely unprepared! Come back when you’ve learned how to throw a Poké Ball! ',
  'It...it...it’s all your fault for challenging me! Next time I’ll turn you into a tasty concasse! ',
  'It...it...it’s all your fault for challenging me! Next time I’ll turn you into a tasty stew! ',
  'It’s a restaurant for Pokémon, not a restaurant of Pokémon!',
  'Customers who don’t even order anything and just sit there flirting are really, like, totally the worst. ',
  'It’s about time for me to give a human my affection, though.',
  'I am happy! Happy, I tell you! Don’t look at me like that! ',
  'It’s all over now... Nobody can stop them... ',
  'It’s been fun... Let’s have another last battle again someday... ',
  'It’s good to battle for fun. If it’s too serious, you won’t enjoy it... ',
  'It’s hard to say good-bye, but we are running out of time...',
  'I did what I came to do, and this is how it turned out. There’s nothing else to say. ',
  'It’s just plain creepy when someone uses compliments to win your attention. Ugh! ',
  'It’s like some sort of dream. Shall I embrace this, too, great roller spirits?',
  'That speed! It’s electrastic! ',
  'It’s like stealin’ candy from a baby! I’m livin’ the good life, all right!',
  'Oh! What a great expression you’re showing! Being crushed by defeat makes you more worth painting! ',
  'It’s my honeymoon! I’m on my honeymoon! I’m definitely not a crazy lady traveling alone!',
  'Traveling alone... Isn’t it great to be so free... ',
  'It’s my mission to protect nature and all the Pokémon living there!',
  'I’m a nature person, so I was born to be a Ranger! ',
  'It’s no holds barred on this journey! Where’s my adventure?!',
  'Travels! Encounters! Love and adventure! Well, where will I find a darling to share it? ',
  'It’s not bad to devote my whole life to research, is it?',
  'The loneliness of genius... There’s no way you could possibly comprehend it. ',
  'It’s not enough... It’s never enough. My bad cholesterol isn’t high enough... ',
  'It’s not like I regret it or anything. A life where you can go crazy about something is a happy life. ',
  'It’s not like I’m calling to the mountains. It’s the mountains that are calling to me! ',
  'It’s not Rough Skin! Rain Dish, Rain Dish. ',
  'It’s OK to bust your tail. But you need some breathing room, too. ',
  'It’s only the first day of my honeymoon trip...and I’m already missing home.',
  'My trip starts here! I’ll beat you and get a ticket! ',
  'It’s said that a Pokémon’s strength depends on its training. It’s not your fault. It can’t be helped. ',
  'I’d love to do a painting of you, you know. (Because I could sell it for a mint! Hah!)',
  'Your disappointed face pleases me. It stirs my creative impulses... ',
  'I’d rather simply have security and happiness than chase a big dream. ',
  'I’ll always work part-time, ’cause it lets me focus on what I really love. ',
  'I’ll be a Pokémon in my next life. ',
  'I’ll do a sketch of you as you are now, frustrated by failure. Please hold still.',
  'Well, pull out a strand of your hair. I need it to make my paintbrush thicker again. ',
  'I’ll give you a battle worthy of a battle-school valedictorian! ',
  'I’ll let my big brother know that this is a fun place. ',
  'I’ll let my big brother know that this is a scary place. ',
  'I’ll let you go this time. Get stronger, then come back and fight me again.',
  'Next time, I wanna battle person versus person, You’re just a kid, though, so I’ll let you off the hook. ',
  'I’ll make you my servant someday. ',
  'I’ll show you the ropes of how to really use Pokémon! ',
  'I’ll show you we can break you. We’ve been training in the field! ',
  'I’m a beginner, but I’ll do my best! I’ll give it everything I can. Watch me! ',
  'I’m a wreck. I’m adrift. It just kills me. It’s so hard to be too stylish.',
  'Even when I lose, I’m still pretty hunky... I’m just that photogenic. ',
  'I’m about to serve you up a slice of battle so exquisite you’ll think I’m the cream of the crop! ',
  'I’m battling here to promote the café that I’m working at.',
  'My part-time job is so fun that I don’t feel like going to school anymore. ',
  'I’m begging for more allowance and saving my money so I can go on a trip around the world someday! ',
  'I’m begging you for a distraction. Show me so much strength that I feel like I must be going crazy. ',
  'I’m bursting with dreams and desires! I’m just a bundle of youthful vigor!',
  'Muwahaha! The legend of my invincibility begins with you! ',
  'I’m Callisto, the boss of the Kalos Coalition. It’d be my pleasure to take you on in battle! ',
  'I’m collecting Poké Balls from all over the world. As long as you’re here, let me show you! ',
  'I’m confident in studying, but I’m just a beginner in Pokémon battles. ',
  'I’m disappointed! I’m disappointed in myself! I tried to play as dirty as I could! ',
  'I’m drowning in Pokémon. It might be too late for me. ',
  'I’m fast! I’m strong! I’m lovely! Nothing less for the Cannon Girl! ',
  'You can’t catch me with a feeble set of muscles like that! ',
  'I’m four years old! I did my best! Trainer, you did your best, too!',
  'Whoa! That’s what I expected from the Champion! Strong! ',
  'I’m four years old! I did my best! Trainer, you were really weak.',
  'I beat the Champion, so I’m the new Champion! ',
  'I’m gaining as much experience as I can because I want to be a Gym Leader someday. ',
  'I’m glad I trusted my instincts... ',
  'I’m glad I won, but I can’t move another inch... Somebody... Get me some food... ',
  'I’m going to battle you with the Pokémon that my darling gave me as a symbol of our love!',
  'Woo-hoo! I’m looking forward to this! I’ve always dreamed of battling here! ',
  'I’m going to tell you something valuable: never expect much from a famous food! ',
  'I’m gonna give it my all. It’s only natural! You can only get results by doing battle!',
  'Just because I’m a Rising Star, don’t expect the freshness of a newcomer. ',
  'I’m gonna give you an experience so sweet that your eyes are gonna spin!',
  'It’s merely a Pokémon battle, right? Why so serious? ',
  'I’m good at battling, but I don’t enjoy it very much.',
  'When I win a battle, my mind goes blank. It’s really worrying. ',
  'I’m good at the strategy and tactics of battles, but I’m bad at throwing Poké Balls! ',
  'I’m having a bad hair day, so there’s nothing I could’ve done. ',
  'I’m honestly not that good at Pokémon battles... When I think about my future, though, it seems like I have no choice but to battle! ',
  'I’m in the middle of eating, but would you be so kind as to let me have a look at your Pokémon? Slurp, slurp... ',
  'I’m not cut out for a regular job, so I make my living on art.',
  'I say it’s art, but really I just want to make easy money. ',
  'I’m not finished with love or Pokémon! I’ll stay fit and ready for both all my life!',
  'Veteran... Makes it sound like I’m finished, for some reason. ',
  'I’m not good at battling, but this is one of the duties of a Poké Fan. ',
  'I’m not prepared to lose, but I won easily anyway. ',
  'I’m not traveling in search of freedom.',
  'The clear blue water at the beach! All the bikinis! That’s the kind of place I was hoping to get to! ',
  'I’m old but still going strong! I can take care of myself!',
  'Hohoho... Is this what they call the wisdom of age? ',
  'I’m sick and tired of being called a Beauty. ',
  'I’m so full of dreams and desires that I’m about to burst! But that’s what it means to be young!',
  'Ha... Are you telling me that your legend just started? ',
  'I’m so happy, I could c-cry! Yip-yip-yippeee! ',
  'I’m so stylish, I hypnotize myself! You’d better keep your distance!',
  'I know, I know, you can’t help but be fascinated by such a pinnacle of hunkiness. ',
  'I’m so well off that life has become tedious. Even experiences like this are fun for me. ',
  'I’m sorry—I’ve been lying. I’m not really a rich girl. ',
  'I’m struggling to make a living, so I’ve been in disguise a long time.',
  'Whenever I say the world is calling me, my mom gets angry and says, “No, it isn’t! Get to work!” ',
  'I’m super popular with ghosts, but we have very ethereal relationships.',
  'Think positive even when you lose? Sounds to me like refusing to admit your mistakes. ',
  'I’m the heroine of justice! You mysterious, evil person! I’ll drive you away! ',
  'I’m the infamous “Cannon Girl” that all the town is raging about! I’ll blast right into your heart!',
  'I’m gonna dive right into your heart! If you don’t catch me, I won’t forgive you! ',
  'I’m tired of doing nothing but serving... So I think it’s time for you to serve me!',
  'Working as a Butler is so fun. Even more so if you like gossip! ',
  'I’m tired of losing battles. Maybe I’ll try going to the Contest Spectacular... ',
  'I’m too homesick to want to do any studying... ',
  'I’m warning you now—if you lose to me, you’ll be smelling the rank scent of defeat!',
  'You want to battle with mois? You’re gonna be rust in my frying pan! ',
  'I’m working very hard, but that doesn’t mean that I’m strong.',
  'To challenge me you must be a reckless, fearless person who doesn’t know his/her place! ',
  'I’ve already got most of the Pokémon and more money than I know what to do with. ',
  'I’ve always loved my Pokémon. I really thought that was true, but... ',
  'I’ve always wanted to be a Beauty, so I’ve made a fresh start, focusing on my appearance. ',
  'I’ve arrived from a distant island. May I please trouble you for a battle?',
  'I battled too much, threw too many Poké Balls, and blew my shoulder out. ',
  'I’ve become a cynical adult, so I even cheat during battles. ',
  'I’ve been studying every single day, so I’m taking a break for a change. ',
  'I’ve been thinking about opening up a traditional restaurant around here someday. ',
  'I’ve got no time at all for expensive dishes. Food from the corner store is really good. ',
  'I’ve got no time for greetings! Food! Give me food, I say! ',
  'I’ve kept the honor of the Poké Fan alive. Hahaha! ',
  'I’ve never done a day of work, because I’m loaded with cash. ',
  'I’ve raised my Pokémon with great care. You’re not allowed to hurt them! ',
  'I’ve recently remade my life completely! I’ve been reborn as a Beauty at last! ',
  'I’ve skated all the way here today! Over fields, mountains, and valleys!',
  'Lots of the metal fixtures on my skates broke, and I’ve been stuck wearing them for close to four years now. ',
  'I’ve spent 20 years trying to find myself... But where am I? ',
  'I’ve trained and trained myself without stopping, so now I’m as fast as the wind!',
  'What I really want to do is surf. But I can’t swim, so I got these Roller Skates. ',
  'Join the Pokémon Fan Club! Your life will be happy! ',
  'Just because I’m Daddy’s little girl, it doesn’t necessarily mean I’m ladylike! ',
  'Just because I’m rich, it doesn’t mean I’m happy. ',
  'Just because they’re both decided by who wins and who loses, don’t liken a battle to a game!',
  'A younger friend of mine just became an Ace Trainer... ',
  'Just being with my Pokémon makes me happy, so it’s OK! ',
  'Keep winning for me, too. Become the number-one Trainer here. ',
  'Kid! Remember me! I am the Worker everybody talks about!',
  'Guess I’ve started to soften up. Hey, can’t expect to stay on top of my game forever. ',
  'La, la, oomph! Now where shall I  start pruning, eh? Snippety-snip!',
  'Whoa! I’m in a Sunny Day kind of mood!! ',
  'Lalalala... Lalalala... Drifting like clouds... ',
  'Lalalala... Lalalala... I am a loner... ',
  'Lalalala... Lalalala... Till we meet again... ',
  'Lemme tell you, I’m mighty strong. Don’t come whining to me after I warned you.',
  'You had better learn that not everybody gets to be the star of the show. ',
  'Let me be brief. You cannot win against me.',
  'Maintaining one’s composure no matter the situation is what being a Trainer is all about. ',
  'Let me guess... You spend a lot of time blaming adults for things you think aren’t “fair,” don’t you? ',
  'Let me stop your winning streak here.',
  'You look kind of feeble. How about I put you through the wringer? ',
  'Let’s have a fun Pokémon battle! ',
  'Let’s start the battle! Time’s a-wasting!',
  'All right, I’m going to start the timer, so let’s get this over with before it goes off! ',
  'Let’s take it easy with Pokémon and with life. ',
  'Like a fragment of a forgotten dream, a mysterious Pokémon beckons to you...',
  'My Fairy says to take you out! ',
  'Listen, I love Pokémon more than life itself! ',
  'Little baby is a winna! Tank you! Tank you! ',
  'Living life for Pokémon... Am I OK with this... ',
  'Lonely guys are easy to be around. You never have to be yourself with them. ',
  'Look, truth is that “passed down for generations”  thing is a joke. Who’d be caught dead in this?',
  'I think furisode are cute, but they’re a bit much for everyday wear. ',
  'Losing is frustrating, but I’m glad I saw you smile. ',
  'Losing, crumbling, weeping! ♪ The path of a traveling woman is closing! ♪ ',
  'Love should conquer all. Love should’ve helped me win...right? ',
  'Ma! Pa! Watch me! I’ll do my best! ',
  'Ma! Pa! Were you watching? I was so strong! ',
  'Ma, Pa... I lost... Get revenge for me... ',
  'Man, I’m so speedy and smooth! I should be on “So You Think You Can Skate!”',
  'I can sing, dance, and skate. Now I’ll try to become an idol who can battle, too. ',
  'Man, the bad things I used to get up to... I’ve done a little of this and whole lotta that.',
  'I’ve never done anything wrong in my whole life. Why do you judge me based on my looks? ',
  'Maybe I’m not really their kid... Maybe their tablets are... ',
  'Mehehehe... Got away this time, did you? I’ll definitely be Gulpin you down next time! ',
  'Mehehehehe... You fool! You know not your place!',
  'The only thoughts in my brain are culinary thoughts. ',
  'Meow, meow, I can haz battle, meow? (Ugh, I really sound like a fool, don’t I?)',
  'Welcome! ',
  'Meowww... I haz lost, meowww. (This job is sooo embarrassing.)',
  'Please come again! ',
  'Merci bien!',
  'What a match! I’m quite satisfied with the result. ',
  'Miniskirts are, like, unbelievable, right? ',
  'Mm-hmm! So fragrant! Such a bouquet! Let me get another whiff of victory!',
  'Did you think you could defeat mois? You’re softer than a bag of marshmallows! ',
  'Mmmm-hahaha! Yahoo! Yahoo! Thank you very much, Pokémon! ',
  'Mommy! Mama-a-a! Waaah! Make the mean Trainer go away!',
  'Wh-why?! Could my father’s words have been wrong? ',
  'Monsieur? What’s there to be so sure about?! I’m sure I’ll bring you down, that’s for sure!',
  'You can’t win just by pretending to be a Trainer! Have a look at my true self! ',
  'Mwahahaha! You lost! Now step right this way, Subject A...',
  'You haven’t studied enough, but you have potential. I could train you, if you’d like... ',
  'Mwahahaha... Yes, I did it! The experiment was a huge success.',
  'Beakers... Petri dishes... Pipettes... Electron microscope... ',
  'Mwahahahaha... Please lend me a hand for my experiment.',
  'I want to experiment! Experiment, I say! My hands are shaking because I want to experiment so badly! ',
  'My amazing punk hair is the secret to my power. ',
  'My bad, my bad! Little too much for ya, huh? But there’s no pullin’ punches in a fight, amirite? ',
  'My Bag is like the sky... In other words, it is empty.',
  'This isn’t a resort—it’s like torture! There are battles everywhere you go! ',
  'My big brother who never comes out of his room told me to come check this place out for him. ',
  'My big brother, look outside for once! I won for you! So come out and play! ',
  'My body and mind aren’t necessarily always in sync. ',
  'My brother told me once... “Eyes! Aim for the eyes!”',
  '“Eyes! Aim for the eyes!” Those were my big brother’s last words... ',
  'My dad and mom are both Veterans, but I am a loser... ',
  'My dad catches Pokémon for me. I don’t know how strong they are, though. ',
  'My dear cuties whisper all kinds of secrets to me...',
  '...Stay away. ',
  'My disciples cover the world! I am the owningest of Owners!',
  'There are no Trainers who know my techniques but can’t cook! ',
  'My dream is simply to be rich.',
  'The reason I’m here battling like this is to try to grab my shot. ',
  'My employer is watching our battle! Would you please be so kind as to lose to me? ',
  'My employer looks angry... I’m in for a reprimand when we get home. ',
  'My family thinks battles are beneath me, but I can’t help but enjoy them. ',
  'My goodness, you are so young! My partners were crushed! ',
  'My job is riding on the result of this battle. ',
  'My journey... No, my adventure of a lifetime hasn’t even begun yet!',
  'I’m not looking for a kid! Tell me where the hunky men are! ',
  'My judgment wasn’t off, though... ',
  'My last ever battle... That’s the way I’d like us to view this match... ',
  'My little lady’s never been to a city like this’n. May’ve bitten off more’n we can chew. Uh-huh.',
  'No, really! Point me in the right direction while there’s still time! ',
  'My love for Pokémon is stronger than anybody else’s. Love can do anything. ',
  'My middle-age spread has given me as much gravitas as the mountains I hike! ',
  'My mom chose my Pokémon. I don’t think they’ll lose to you.',
  'My father, a great man, always said, “The ends justify the means as long as you win!” ',
  'My new wife and I are hitchhiking for our honeymoon, ’cause we have no money. ',
  'My nurturing methods are perfect! I could beat the Champion with ease, I bet! ',
  'My oh my! My Pokémon knocked it out of the park! ',
  'My parents are totally there for me when I lose, so why bother thinking about what I could’ve done better? ',
  'My parents are, like, stupidly obsessed with me, so I’ve grown up to be magnificently stupid. ',
  'My parents totally spoil me when I win, so I get pretty full of myself. I mean, wouldn’t you? ',
  'My Pokémon and I ARE strong! Thank you, Dad! ',
  'My Pokémon and I are the strongest, so there’s no way we could have truly lost. ',
  'My Pokémon and I are the strongest. We’ll take care of each and every one of you. ',
  'My Pokémon and I are weak... Stupid Dad! ',
  'My Pokémon and I were the strongest. We took care of each and every one of you. ',
  'My Pokémon are my pride and joy, so take your time and enjoy this battle with them.',
  'My life hasn’t been a bed of roses— not exactly overflowing with opportunities. ',
  'My Pokémon are the mightiest! I shall carve my name in history! ',
  'My Pokémon are the strongest. I don’t think I will lose to you.',
  'If you’re willing to battle with me, you must have something pretty good, right? ',
  'My Pokémon could get hurt, so I can’t take them out here. ',
  'My research will lead this world to peace and joy.',
  'My research was supposed to lead the world to peace... ',
  'My wovely widdle Pokémon are gonna take you apart, mmkay?',
  'Talking...is not...my thing. Let’s just battle. ',
  'My ’net friends said I wouldn’t be taken lightly with this look. ',
  'N-no! This is, uh...just a fluke! I really am a noob!',
  'The content of my training was good. I have to thank my teacher for this! ',
  'N-non! Not so fast! I mean you to be the prize bloom in my garden!',
  'If only my Ability were Rain Dish... ',
  'New age simply refers to twentieth century classical composers, right?',
  'Don’t get hung up on sadness or frustration. You can use your grudges to motivate yourself. ',
  'Next time I see you, I will turn you into a Pokémon with my power.',
  'I’m disappointed, but it can’t be helped... My prophecies are absolute... ',
  'Ngh! Nosebleed! When I get too excited, my blood pressure goes through the roof!',
  'My Pokémon and I are fully prepared! Bring it on, Trainer! ',
  'No matter how mentally prepared you are, weak Trainers are weak! Hahaha! ',
  'No matter how much you love your Pokémon, you still have to discipline them when they misbehave.',
  'Pokémon...are nice... They may be selfish, but they won’t betray you. ',
  'No matter how speedy the Pokémon is, I’ll catch it on my super-speedy skates!',
  'I’m being marketed as an idol who can sing, dance, and skate, but it’s just no good. ',
  'No one but my master will ever make me bow!',
  'I deceived my master by saying I was running errands and came here to play. ',
  'No one can stop me now that I’m as fast as the wind itself!',
  'No matter how good I get on these Roller Skates, I still don’t feel like I’m any more popular with the ladies. ',
  'No Pokémon or Trainer can escape me on my speedy skates!',
  'When I stop and think about it, being dressed like this all the time makes me more of a comedian than an idol. ',
  'No pouting when you lose, ’cause that’s just lame. ',
  'No problem. No problem. I’ll have another chance. ',
  'No way... I’m actually pretty good! Or are you just a total amateur?',
  'I had no plan, but I won anyway! Maybe I shouldn’t overthink things! ',
  'No way... NO WAY! How could I lose again... ',
  'No work and all play makes me a dull girl. Do you think I don’t know that? ',
  'No! I don’t want to go home! I don’t want to have to study! ',
  'No! I lost! ',
  'No! I’m steaming mad! How could I lose to someone with a face like that?! ',
  'NO! My...my family! What have you done?!',
  'If I lose, that tells you I was just killing time. It doesn’t damage my ego at all. ',
  'No...wait... Don’t run away... You’re supposed to be my Butler...',
  'Being a Butler is fun because you can see a side of people that they hide from everyone. ',
  'Nobody scolds me. That’s why Pokémon battles are the best! ',
  'Non, non! A dash of defeat is not called for in my recipe book! C’est pas possible! ',
  'Not yet! My Pokémon can still stand! It’s not over! They can still stand!',
  'You and your Pokémon are nice. Trade Pokémon with me! ',
  'Nothing stirs the soul like Pokémon moves.',
  'Your overconfidence is your weakness. Wasn’t that an unexpected result for you? ',
  'Now do you understand the ability of someone who’s at the head of the class? ',
  'Now my head is ringing, now my head is ringing. Ding ding dong! Ding ding dong!',
  'Don’t you think it’s better to take trips alone or with someone you love or something! ',
  'Now you understand, eh? Don’t be so impudent as to think you could defeat me! ',
  'Now you’ve been dragged down, too. I think we could become friends now.',
  'Kind people are scary... Their smiling faces and boisterousness are scary... ',
  'Now, let’s see... If I accidentally beat my master... I know! I get on my knees and beg for forgiveness!',
  'All right! From now on I’m your boss. ',
  'Now, let’s see... If my master easily defeats me... I know! That is the ideal moment for some flattery!',
  'Serving people is tough. You can’t choose your boss, so it’s stressful. ',
  'Obedient Pokémon, selfish Pokémon... Pokémon have unique characteristics.',
  'Even though my upbringing and behavior are poor, I’ve raised my Pokémon well. ',
  'Of course, you are the main character!',
  'You have to be strong inside when there aren’t many people who are stronger than you on the outside... ',
  'Oh bother! It’s just SUCH a hassle the way that I am always winning with my Pokémon!',
  'I don’t think you can say you’ve been on a trip unless you’ve interacted with the locals. ',
  'Oh dear! You aren’t quite fresh enough, are you? Not even fit for a mess hall! ',
  'Oh my goodness! My poor Pokémon... ',
  'Oh my! You’ve passed with flying colors! ',
  'Oh my, did you get too close? What are you, some kind of perfume fanatic?',
  'Huh? Did I win? Then we can’t escape! ',
  'Oh my, our battle was just as gorgeous. I feel drawn to you. ',
  'Oh my... It looks like you’ll be repeating this lesson. ',
  'Oh no! I forgot to take off my uniform before I came! ',
  'Oh no! It’s over already? The Hiker hunk is bored!!',
  'Yay! The Hiker won! Love and gratitude to my Pokémon! ♪ ',
  'Oh no, don’t bother them like that! Please leave my Pokémon alone...',
  'I should know that a theory is just a theory. It was of no use in an actual battle... ',
  'Oh no, what a disgrace! I’m sure my master will dock my pay for this.',
  'How wonderful! Won’t you hire me? I do command quite a salary, though. ',
  'Oh phooey! Don’t you ever come back! If you do, we’re gonna end you, mmkay?',
  'Talking is not my thing. Neither is losing. I’m going home. ',
  'Oh! Aren’t you the lucky one! I hope you also had fun, though. ',
  'Oh! Bother and vexation! This is just too much! I can’t stand how good it feels to win all the time!',
  'This is it... I’m fully enjoying this trip. ',
  'Oh! I forgot to finish off our battle! I still need to study more... ',
  'Oh! I’ve got myself a win! ♪ Walk on, down the path of a battling woman! ♪ ',
  'Oh! Yer a bad guy, aren’t ya? I’ll stand up to ya! ',
  'Oh, do you want to see the Pokémon I am proudest of? ',
  'Oh, forget it! I’m done with fancy clothes! I’m ditching this outfit and going to get a tan!',
  'I don’t care if I win or lose, as long as I can escape from this tedium. ',
  'Oh, I wish I could crawl inside a Poké Ball to live! Ooh, I want to be ordered what moves to do! ',
  'Oh, Master, where art thou?',
  'O master, where art thou... Perhaps I should lower my standards... ',
  'Oh, there’s a kick to you! You must tell me your secret ingredient! ',
  'Oh, wh-whoa. I’m no match for you. Your Pokémon are somethin’ else.',
  'This battle was a valuable experience. I still need to gain more experience! ',
  'Oh, you are so cute! Come, I promise to be nice this battle.',
  'Oh... Trainer... Isn’t it time...for a battle? ',
  'Oh, you look lively! What d’ya say we battle? ',
  'Oh. The Pokémon did the fighting. My strong kick didn’t help a bit.',
  'Hmmm... If I was going to lose anyway, I was hoping to get totally messed up in the process. ',
  'Oh... Don’t look at me like that. Smile! Smile! ',
  'Oh... I think I’ll go back to the kitchen and have a nice slice of some humble pie... ',
  'Oh... You are quite the fan... You are qualified to join the Pokémon Fan Club... ',
  'Oh? Aren’t you a child? Who said you could come here?',
  'Adults are pretty unfair, but that’s what makes it fun. ',
  'Ohhh, a strong enemy! Is there a continue option somewhere?',
  'Once you’ve made it this far, victory and defeat become meaningless. ',
  'Ohhh... Could you please give me an order?',
  'The pay from my part-time job is good, so that’s why I’m able to battle like this. ',
  'Ohhhh... Calculation and analysis are perhaps no match for chance... ',
  'OK! We’re all done here! How were my partners? ',
  'OK, OK. All right, all right. Justice has to win in the end. ',
  'Old guys and kids can both enjoy battling with Pokémon. ',
  'On my days off, the real me can appear! Yes, I am an Ace Trainer!',
  'I feel like the world is waiting for me... You know how I feel, right? ',
  'Only my research is left in my life. I abandoned my family and friends.',
  'In my pursuit of success, I became lonely beyond all imagining... ',
  'Only Pokémon rescue me from boring and monotonous days.',
  'This is still just playing. Just playing. You have to feel as comfortable as that. ',
  'Only the winner! Yes, sir! Only the winner can celebrate!',
  'I tried to lose on purpose to make you feel good... This is no good. I’m definitely getting fired for this... ',
  'Ooh la la! I’ll pay you back for this someday! ',
  'Ooh la la! Little Trainer! Graceful blossom! I’m going to snippety-snip you right at the stem!',
  'The weather’s too awful for me to work! I’m just amusing myself here. ',
  'Oooh! I’ve spotted some handy prey! The hunt is about to begin... Game on!',
  'This is battle paradise. Only the strong survive here... ',
  'Oops, you weren’t as strong as I expected. Looks can be deceiving. ',
  'Order up! One glorious victory in a Pokémon battle, sunny-side up.',
  'I was so focused on manners that I overlooked a chance to win. ',
  'Order up! One humiliation in a Pokémon battle, over easy.',
  'We’re competing to see who wins and who loses, so of course we have manners. ',
  'Ouais! Where is the life? Where is the vigor? It would not even tempt a half-starved Skitty! ',
  'Our feelings for each other are so strong that the loneliness will be terrible after we say good-bye. ',
  'Our lives have plenty of ordinary days...so I gotta have Pokémon!',
  'It’s no fun if you’re not ready to treat it like you’re playing instead of battling. ',
  'Outstanding! From this day, you may call me “Master”!',
  'See this smile? It comes from knowing my employers’ secrets. ',
  'Ow! Ow! Ow! My face! I’m the poster child for windburn!',
  'I bet guys who can surf get more girls than guys on Roller Skates. I wish I could surf... ',
  'Pah. I was sooo close to signing you up as my new test subject!',
  'Just because you know a lot about battles, it doesn’t mean that you know anything about Pokémon! ',
  'People can become strong if they have clear goals. That’s just the way it goes.',
  'I’m just good at battling. I don’t even have a job. I’m just another unemployed guy. ',
  'Perhaps I could have gone even faster if you hadn’t resisted me?',
  'If you skate too much, the wheels get worn out. It’s such a waste. ',
  'Perhaps the beauty I’ve been looking for...is you?',
  'Go forth! Pay no heed to losers! Go, go, and live your life! ',
  'Pffft! I wasn’t seriously trying or nothing! Next time I’ll show you some real ownage!',
  'Pffft! I wasn’t seriously trying or anything! Next time I’ll show you some real ownage! ',
  'Phew... You are smoking hot! It’s like a sweltering summer night in here!',
  'It’s not like you really lose anything when you lose. As long as you enjoy it, that’s enough. ',
  'Phew... You’ve got some good Pokémon on your side, all right. ',
  'Please come to the gallery to see my works! (You look dumb enough to buy something!)',
  'Your triumphant face pleases me. It stirs my creative impulses... ',
  'Please donate money for a rich, healthy environment and for the sake of Pokémon.',
  'Everything has its origin in nature! Everyone should revere it! ',
  'Please don’t leave! Things were going so well! I have such great plans for us! ',
  'Please wait! I’m sure I can create a masterpiece with you as my model!',
  'Hmmph... I won’t tell you the secret of my paintbrush. ',
  'Pokémon are good at doing what they’re told. Me? I absolutely can’t stand being ordered around. ',
  'Pokémon are my family! See the solidarity of my family!',
  'When you’re tired of training Pokémon, it’s time to battle! That’s the trick to working as a Breeder! ',
  'Pokémon are popular at work, too. Even us guys enjoy these battles! ',
  'Pokémon battles after work are the one joy in my life. ',
  'Pokémon battles and study sessions are much the same. Let’s be efficient!',
  'If you slacked off on your studies, you’ve got no chance. Capable girls like me are capable. ',
  'Pokémon battles are not enough of a challenge. I want it to be personal!',
  'Don’t look so down! ♪ I just happened to get lucky! ♪ ',
  'Pokémon battles are so much fun. There’s no way I can quit!',
  'Now there ain’t nobody buggin’ me about stuff, so’s I can battle as much as I want! ',
  'Pokémon never betray you. They return all the love you give them.',
  'Unlike humans, Pokémon never betray you. That’s why I decided to love them. ',
  'Pokémon will be strong or weak depending on how you raise them.',
  'How about that? Strong, huh? What you eat is important! ',
  'Preschooler gonna battle you! Oh yeah! Nice to meet you. ',
  'Protect Mother Nature! Or I will put you in jail!',
  'I’m a marvel of nature! ',
  'Ready for the big game? Got your cap on straight? ',
  'Regardless of who wins or loses, we should thank each other after a battle. ',

  'Remember this, you! I am a big Poké Fan! ',
  'S-so you’ve come to challenge me! Get too close, and I will sauté you! ',
  'Sacre bleu! As of this day, you’ve owned the Owner of all Owners!',
  'What sort of Trainer is this... That flavor is too peculiar to eat... ',
  'Scary places are the best to me. I’d love to live in a cemetery...',
  'I was born in a graveyard and raised in a cemetery. Leave all your curses and grudges to me! ',
  'See... I knew I couldn’t win. I’m not cut out for competition. ',
  'See? Travel is best when you’re young and poor. ',
  'See? What did I tell you?  Are you ill or something?',
  'I just beat the Champion even though I don’t even have one Gym Badge... ',
  'Seeing Pokémon from all over the world is the purpose of my journey. ',
  'Sensitivity is important for battles, too. You! Start feeling right now!',
  'You’ve got potential! All right! I’ll make you my apprentice! ',
  'Seriously, I lost. That is, like, seriously depressing, but you were seriously cool. ',
  'Seriously, winning a serious battle is seriously the best! ',
  'Shall I give you a tip for training good Pokémon?',
  'There’s a lot that goes into being a Pokémon Breeder. ',
  'Shall I share an exclusive tip for training great Pokémon?',
  'How much time do you spend raising each Pokémon? ',
  'Sheesh! Can’t you see that I’m just a kid! It wasn’t fair of you to go all out like that! ',
  'Shhh. Rest now and close your eyes... You won’t ever need open them again...',
  'My Fairy told me to do it! It’s all my Fairy’s fault! ',
  'Six months’ investment in the latest treatments... Look at me now! I glow like never before! ',
  'Skates alive! What a battle!',
  'Apparently electrastic isn’t a real word. I’ll keep using it because it’s cool, though. ',
  'Slobber... Oooh, a tasty-looking Trainer and Pokémon have wandered my way... ',
  'Slurp... This is so tasty... Bring them closer so I can get a good look. Slurp, slurp. ',
  'Snicker snicker! ',
  'Snicker snicker... ',
  'Sniffle sniffle... ',
  'Sniffle... Maybe it’s ’cause I’m so stupidly strong that no normal boys come near me...',
  'Maybe it’s bad that I never give halfway strong guys a chance... ',
  'Sniffle... Sniffle sniffle... I’m disappointed... So disappointed... ',
  'So it seems victory has chosen me. ',
  'So-called talent is no more than an illusion... The efforts of one’s own are all that is real.',
  'OK, OK... I lose. Maybe I’ll just keep working kind of hard. ',
  'So? It was delicious, right?! Have some more then! MORE! ',
  'Sob... Sob... Who needs this? I’m going home to my mother!',
  'The train called victory has left without me... My trip ends here... ',
  'Soft! You’re too soft! You’ll never get into the Pokémon Fan Club like that! ',
  'Someday, you will appreciate the value of defeat and sorrow.',
  'Give me back those 88 years! Give me back my art! ',
  'Someone like me winning something like a battle? City slickers sure are weak these days, ain’t they?',
  'In this part of the world, do you sic your Pokémon on someone asking a simple question? ',
  'Sometimes I drive myself crazy wondering why I wasn’t born a Pokémon. ',
  'Sometimes I need a little time to rest. I’m gonna take it easy this battle, OK? ',
  'Sorry if I bored you! I’ll try harder next time! ',
  'Sorry, pal. Nothing personal, but I’m abouts to go all kinds of crazy on your Pokémon! ',
  'Sparkling eyes, firm skin... I won’t get them back.',
  'If you think people will go easy on you because you’re a child, you’re in for a painful lesson. ',
  'Speech can be utter nonsense. Pretty words only taint battles...',
  'I let it slip that I’m a greenhorn right before the battle. ',
  'St-stay away from me! Get too close, and I will julienne you! ',
  'Stop right there! We haven’t reached the final course yet! ',
  'Stop! I’m going to have to ask you not to move. Just sit back and see what I do with my shears!',
  'Hey there! I’m a Gardener! My scissors are my only real friends. ',
  'Stop! Just hold on a moment! I don’t want to be flambéed! ',
  'Stop! Just hold on a moment! I don’t want to be grilled over a flame! ',
  'Such a looker lost to me?! I’m a little disappointed. ',
  'Such an immodest way of battling! I just can’t be around it! ',
  'Sucks, don’t it? If you don’t like that feeling, you better be ready to do anything to win! ',
  'Take a look at these Pokémon—I raised ’em myself. They make me right proud. ',
  'Take that! My Pokémon have never even heard of words like sedate!',
  'See... Look at this glossy coat. I’m slobbering in spite of myself. ',
  'Take that, evildoer! I am the pretty soldier of “Prettiness and Pokémon”!',
  'My view is that whether or not your prayers get answered all depends on your own talents! ',
  'Talent is not something that can be gained, and strength grows weak if it is not used.',
  'Apparently, hard work will never let you down. Couldn’t it be enough to work kind of hard? ',
  'Talent? Hah! It’s just a convenient excuse lazy Trainers use to explain away their losses.',
  'First comes practice. Second comes slacking off. Third and fourth come panic and more panic. Fifth comes battle... ',
  'Talk is unnecessary... I will just break you...',
  'Oof... My body is weary from doing so much housework, so I’m looking forward to this. ',
  'Tee hee! My mom did my makeup! I’m actually only seven years old! ',
  'Tee hee... I won because I’m a grown-up! ',
  'Tell me the truth... Roller skating isn’t even cool anymore, is it?',
  'Always slipping around is annoying! I’m ready to graduate from Roller Skates! ',
  'Terrible bosses, all the annoyances— I can forget it all while I’m battling. ',
  'Thank goodness... In terms of strength, at least, you have little resemblance to my former master.',
  'Oh, this is so irritating! Why don’t you understand me? ',
  'Thank you so much for losing! My employer is sitting over there smiling! ',
  'Thank you so very much for spending time with a novice like me, still so young I wet the bed. ',
  'Thank you! Merci bien! You’ve beat a Rich Boy! ',
  'Thanks for coming! What’d you think? Did my Pokémon suit your tastes? ',
  'Thanks to my Pokémon, I spend every day totally addicted to my part-time job. ',
  'That could have gone better, but I do thank you very much. ',
  'That if your life can really be changed by traveling, you haven’t been living it right.',
  'Lovely memories from my trip live on forever in my Poké Ball. ',
  'That in the end, east or west, home is best.',
  'When I’m with the Pokémon I brought home from my travels, it brings back lovely memories of my trip. ',
  'That strength... You’re like a thriving roadside weed... ',
  'That was a nice and easy win. I’ll work hard again tomorrow! ',
  'That was close... I just barely lost... Thanks to the service I provided, I can keep my job. ',
  'That was pretty amazingly fun! You’ve totally exhausted me... ',
  'That was quite an experience. The data I got from you will help me grow stronger. ',
  'That was some kind of loss. Was there some sort of trap?!',
  'You! Why did you lose? Again? You’re trying to fool me again, aren’t you?! ',
  'That was superb, sir/miss! You are strong indeed. ',
  'That was supposed to be refreshing, but now I feel more stressed out. ',
  'That’s fine by me! I like a strong partner! But you’d never take me in a bare-knuckle fight. ',
  'That’s quite enough focusing. Stop staring at me like that! ',
  'That’s right! If you only have a pair of Roller Skates, you can go anywhere!',
  'My Roller Skates have become like a part of my body now. ',
  'The battle between us two... Within and of itself, that is art.',
  'Before we waste our time on idle chat, please show me your skills. ',
  'The battle is just the means. Victory is always the goal.',
  'You did better than I thought. You’ve got quite a bit of potential. ',
  'The battles continue forever! Welcome to the world with no end! ',
  'The class differences always tell. I’m worried about your future, kid. ',
  'The Contest Spectacular is just superficial. It’s just not in my nature at all. ',
  'The days that I spend dedicated to my art... That is the art of youth!',
  'I want to paint over every bit of the scenery in this ugly town! ',
  'The dazzling romance of battle will make you grow into a real adult...',
  'So what if you lose? It’s not like there’s any money in winning. ',
  'The endless process of entropy... That is where nature’s true beauty lies.',
  'I’m a Gardener, but I’m good at Pokémon battles, too. ',
  'The fact that you are so strong... It means you have too much free time, doesn’t it?',
  'For reals? Did I, like, win for reals?! Whoa, crazy! Like, I’m too strong! ',
  'The first flush of youth... It is too bright for me...',
  'I feel so satisfied when I defeat a child! It feels like I’ve regained my own youth! ',
  'The gals of the Kalos region, like yeah... Ooh, ooh, ooh, we battle, ooh yeah... ',
  'The guy I like is, like, totally bad... I’m gonna be real bad for that cad... ',
  'The International Butlering Competition is drawing near, so allow me to practice my skills on you!',
  'I’m tired of serving my boss. You there! Serve me now! ',
  'The job site can be quite dangerous, but I have to keep working with my Pokémon.',
  'Well, I’m going to do things my way, so feel free to battle however you like. ',
  'The journey isn’t over. Just you wait! I’ll show you the greatest adventure ever!',
  'Sniff, sniff... This is no good... I can’t smell the perfume of love. Bye! ',
  'The kinds of fashion you can pull off have a pesky expiration date. We call it “age.”',
  'You had better think about your age when picking out clothes, right? ',
  'The main character of the story is me! You are just an extra!',
  'I thought I’d grow up to be a frail woman who looked like she’d break if you squeezed her too hard. ',
  'The main character of this story... I’ll tell you who it is!',
  'Because I’m an Ace Trainer, people think I’m a strong woman. ',
  'The master I was serving disappeared one day. Now I am a masterless Butler—a ronin retainer!',
  'I’ve been searching for a master I can serve for 10 years. I’m a wandering Butler... ',
  'The moment that I hadn’t beat you in five seconds, I’d already lost...to myself.',
  'How could you be quicker than me? What are you wearing? ',
  'The more I spike my hair, the stronger I am! ',
  'The ones to blame are the ones who buy this junk. They’re the ones who think it’s worth something.',
  'That battle itself was art, but can’t you make more out of your winning pose? ',
  'The only factor in whether or not I like a Pokémon is its strength. ',
  'The only thing I enjoy is a Pokémon battle... ',
  'The pedigree and upbringing of my Pokémon are totally different than some mutt’s! ',
  'The Poké Fan is power. ',
  'The Pokémon Fan Club is a secret organization into which only a chosen few may enter. ',
  'The Pokémon you use... Do you really like them? ',
  'The pretty-suited Pokémon soldier who sprinkles love on the world appears!',
  'I don’t believe in things like good luck charms, but times like these make me want to pray! ',
  'The problem is when I’m dressed like this, the man of my dreams gets weirded out and pulls away from me. ',
  'The real trick behind training good Pokémon is catching good Pokémon.',
  'The most fun part of this job is getting close to Pokémon. ',
  'The secret ingredient in my cooking will be your tears! ',
  'The sting of defeat will become a good memory when you grow older.',
  'I am overcome by the reverberations of victory. A toast to our companions in their Poké Balls! ',
  'The story has it that this precious kimono was passed down within my family for generations...',
  'If you’re wondering why I’m dressed like this, isn’t it obvious it’s for my part-time job? ',
  'The thrill and adrenaline has me racing! You look like you’re almost standing still!',
  'I may not get a runner’s high, but I get a Roller Skater’s rush, so I’m always all smiles! ',
  'The truth is that I’m a time traveler. I just popped by from the future.',
  'I knew this cheap package tour wouldn’t be any good. ',
  'The truth is that I’m nothing more than the daughter of a Clerk ♂. ',
  'The truth is that my “perfume” is nothing more than the scent of my cheap fabric softener.',
  'All right! Now I can make my escape! ',
  'There are no such things as brakes on MY skates!',
  'My parents said they’re too dangerous, so I made my own Roller Skates. ',
  'There are young and beautiful people, but youth is different from beauty. ',
  'There aren’t as many people battling at work these days because they’ve moved on to the Contest Spectacular. ',
  'There’s a certain etiquette to battles with glamorous, elegant ladies. ',
  'There’s a limit to how far I could get studying by myself, so I started taking battle lessons. ',
  'They are too attached to me. They are not fit for battling. ',
  'They say perseverance can move mountains. I won’t give up yet, I tells ya! ',
  'They say that the rich don’t have to fight for anything, but I LOVE a good battle!',
  'Shall we go together? To the other side of Pokémon battles... ',
  'They say with age comes wisdom, but that never seems to have worked for me.',
  'You have to be careful! Pokémon battles can steal away so much of your time... ',
  'They’re easy to move in and cute. Anything but a miniskirt would be unbelievable, right? ',
  'They’ve gotta be defective or something! Please! Someone! Anyone! STOP ME!',
  'They’re just for show, so the wheels don’t turn. I run really fast to make it seem like I’m rolling. ',
  'This buzz after battle is the best! It’s like I just closed a big deal!',
  'Not yet. We have not crossed the finish line of Pokémon battles. ',
  'This is a uniform from an anime. Doesn’t it look good on me?',
  'Just wearing the fashions that I like gets me excited! ',
  'This is important, so remember it: don’t judge a book by its cover!',
  'You made my Pokémon cry! I’m gonna break down and howl, too! ',
  'This is my honeymoon! B-but... But I’ve lost my wife somewhere... ',
  'This is Rough Skin, isn’t it?! Rain Dish, Rain Dish... ',
  'This is Rough Skin, isn’t it?! Rain Dish, Rain Dish? ',
  'This isn’t a uniform—it’s just what I like to wear. I made it myself.',
  'This isn’t some kind of cosplay! This is just my style. ',
  'This might be useful for you to learn. Your preconceived notions are more powerful than you think. ',
  'This proves my Pokémon have accepted my love.',
  'This proves my Pokémon have accepted my love. ',
  'This victory proves my true love for Pokémon. ',
  'This, that, and the other were like my thing, you know what I’m saying?',
  'This outfit is a hand-me-down from my mother that she wore when she was young. ',
  'This...this can’t be... How could I be beaten at my own game...',
  'Everything she knows about Pokémon she learned from me. It’s not fair. Why is she an Ace Trainer when I’m not? ',
  'Though I guess I should probably be buying local...',
  'It’s not like anybody is ever really happy to get souvenirs from people anyway. ',
  'Though the level of the Trainers in this region... Well, they’re nothing worth writing home about.',
  'Though the level of Trainers in this region... Well, they’re not worth writing home about. ',
  'Though the truth is that I just made him a TV dinner because I wanted some time alone!',
  'I don’t want to go home! I want to keep traveling! ',
  'Thought you might make trouble for me, but what a wimpy attack! ',
  'Three-star restaurants? Shopping? Sightseeing? It’s all so...so ANNOYING! I’m about to lose it!',
  'I was a fool to think that I would find sweet romance at my destination. ',
  'To think that anybody could be stronger than me! ...You’re not just anybody! ',
  'To think that I was grounded due to you... Ohhh! I’d better get a hotel voucher at least!',
  'I’m sleepy all the time because of jet lag. I don’t have the energy for sightseeing... ',
  'Too much praise can spoil both Pokémon and people.',
  'The only thing I still believe in... is my Pokémon... ',
  'Trainer, I yield!  Please spare me!',
  'You didn’t take it easy on me at all... That was good. You’re a risk taker. ',
  'Trainer, you are at my mercy!',
  'Reflect long and hard on what “serious” means. ',
  'Trainers who treat battles as a sport are the height of vileness.',
  'You’re not well enough prepared yet. ',
  'Tsk tsk. That wasn’t much of a showing. You’re not enough of a fan yet. ',
  'Tsk! I’m not paying any tip, you hear?',
  'Places you don’t know are scary... Just lounging around the house is the best... ',
  'U-ugh... Rather strong, aren’t you? I suppose I might not mind serving you...',
  'My master hates both Pokémon and battles, so there’s no other way for me to come here. ',
  'Ugh! You’re not what I was hoping for! You and your Pokémon have some growing up to do. ',
  'Ugh, I’m broken...',
  'Unnh... Not yet... I can still keep going... ',
  'Ugh. Cough, cough! I don’t feel so well. Please show a little kindness...',
  'I’m, umm, teaching my daughter, umm, about Pokémon. I have to, umm, show her her dad’s, umm, dignity. ',
  'Ugh. I won’t be able to make any money tomorrow with these injuries!',
  'There’s something nice and comfortable about the pace you and your Pokémon keep to. ',
  'Ugh... It wasn’t supposed to be like this. Did I administer the wrong blend?',
  'How could that happen to my Pokémon... What are you feeding your Pokémon? ',
  'Ugh... My powers... My powers are... I think I need a nurse...',
  'Eh...radio waves... There are radio waves coming from your nose... ',
  'Uh-oh! You’re OK, aren’t you? Sorry I flew into a rage! ',
  'Uhhh... It’s not...stopping... I’m starting to feel...kinda...dizzy...',
  'I was so well prepared, though... Could it be that my skills are lacking? ',
  'Uhhn... I can’t get enough of the feeling of loss when the winner looks disdainfully at me... ',
  'Uhhn... It’s getting cold... I was almost finished cooking... ',
  'Um, that was what you call a battle, right? You lost, so now you have to be my servant! ',
  'Um, this is what you call a battle, right? Why do we do stuff like this again? ',
  'Um, um, um, you know what? These Pokémon are my friends. ',
  'Umm, that was what you call a battle, right? I lost, so now do I have to be your servant? ',
  'Unfortunately, you’ve lost to me. Now, give me your lunch money! ',
  'Unngh. What disappointment... I can’t allow myself to lose to mutts. ',
  'Urk! F-farewell for now! I’ll remember this, child! ',
  'Urrrrrrrgh... You got me good! I’m single... Battling is my only pleasure in life. ',
  'Victory is a shallow and fleeting illusion.  Your eventual defeat is a fait accompli.',
  'What would my life have been like without Pokémon? ',
  'Victory is what makes battling worth it. What what?! I just dropped knowledge! ',
  'Victory will never come to those who aren’t prepared to face defeat. ',
  'Waaah! I should have superior genes and be able to ride on my parents’ coattails... ',
  'WAAAH! ',
  'Waahhh! You’re scary! Stop picking on me! ',
  'Wahaha! Justice wins! I’m gonna exile you! ',
  'Wait up a second! Hey! Don’t you know who I am? ',
  'Wanna give me a hand with my training? It’s all for the sake of my future dreams!',
  'People say I’m a diamond in the rough. Sure you wanna battle with me? ',
  'Watch out! I’m always ripped and raring to go! Show me a Pokémon that’s beyond the beyond!',
  'My Pokémon are all extremely rare ones that I acquired on the black market. ',
  'Watch out! You’re on the menu next! ',
  'We cannot believe we spent time on such a childish battle! Leave at once!',
  'This result... is not what I’d hoped for... ',
  'We have reached closing time for today. We look forward to seeing you again soon. ',
  'We need a lot of money to protect Mother Nature and her Pokémon.',
  'I’m prepared to protect nature by any means necessary! ',
  'We protect forests and Pokémon by gathering money and planting trees.',
  'Are you listening? Remember this... Never underestimate the power of nature... ',
  'We truly thank you for your patronage. Please do come again. ',
  'We will meet again someday... Heh. If only that were true... ',
  'We would like to hold a Pokémon battle against the strongest foe.',
  'There’s nothing to do but battle... For us... ',
  'Welcome! Welcome! Pokémon Trainers, right this way! ',
  'Welcome, good sir/fair lady. Shall I take your coat for you? ',
  'Welcome, welcome! Step right up! Step right up and battle a spell!',
  'I’m what you call a professional punching bag. I work here to earn a living. ',
  'Well done! You were lovely! I can’t imitate that! ',
  'Well done, brothers and sisters! Our family solidarity is invincible!',
  'I’m so talented that I can win just to change my mood. ',
  'Well, ain’t you something... All right, then. I’m stepping down—you’re the new boss! ',
  'Well, aren’t you quite pathetic? This is what happens when you can select an opponent.',
  'It took a while before I learned my place. ',
  'Well, even if you work diligently, things don’t always go as hoped.',
  'Sorry I couldn’t be more accommodating. Have a safe trip home. ',
  'Well, I only won by chance. Please don’t pay it any mind. ',
  'Well, it is only the natural outcome. The power of science is awesome.',
  'This result was inevitable. Victory is simply derived. ',
  'Well, I’m a hooligan. If you ain’t scared of me, I ain’t doin’ it right! ',
  'Well, I’ve got nothing but time on my hands. You don’t look busy. Keep me company! ',
  'Well, Poké Balls are actually all the same anywhere you go in the world, though. ',
  'Well, well, you strike impressive poses. If you lose, I hope you’ll model for me.',
  'My paintbrush is made of secret materials. ',
  'Well, well... You’re not even in my league. This is like bullying.',
  'To me, etiquette is mercilessly defeating my opponents in battle—even the weak. ',
  'Well, you helped me kill some time. I’m satisfied with that. ',
  'Well, you’re not my master, so I guess you can’t help being weak.',
  'Oh no... I’m glad I won the battle, but I tore my uniform! ',
  'We’re about to battle, but that doesn’t mean we can’t be polite! Good luck! ',
  'Wh-where do you study? I want to study there, too! ',
  'Wh-why do my Pokémon look like they are having so much fun battling you?',
  'Quit talking about my age. ',
  'What a bunch of louts! Don’t they even get that I’m always working my tail off over here!',
  'Ace Trainers past a certain age have all changed their careers. ',
  'What a cruel way to treat such a helpless old man! Shame on you!',
  'What an inconsiderate act—beating up on an old man and his Pokémon! ',
  'What a pushover you were! That was a piece of cake, my little cream puff! ',
  'What a shame. It looks like I’ve dulled my precious pruning shears on an ordinary weed.',
  'My specialty and my hobby are both cutting things! My favorite move with scissors is Guillotine! ',
  'What a waste! If only I could beat those rich jerks I work for this nice and easy!',
  'Past a certain age, it’s time to hang up on being an Ace Trainer and move on. ',
  'What are you doing? You made that worthless! Totally worthless! ',
  'What can you learn from a defeat? All you feel is regret, right? ',
  'What do you think about my  dear Pokémon? Great, right? ',
  'What do you think of my Pokémon? They’re fresh! ',
  'What do you think you’re doing to my adorable Pokémon? ',
  'What do you think?! Hawesome, huh? My Pokémon and I are the strongest! ',
  'What do you wish to do now? Shall I leave and relieve you of your shame?',
  'I can’t remember what orders I gave... B-but I won! ',
  'What d’you think you’re lookin’ at?! You’ve got some kind of nerve, kid! ',
  'What kind of Pokémon do you like? Hey, come on, show me! ',
  'What my brother told me was right... Thanks, Bro...',
  'My big brother was right... Watch over me, bro... ',
  'What you like doing and what you’re good at doing aren’t always the same.',
  'I’ve become so absorbed in Pokémon battles that I’ve started to worry about myself. ',
  'What! B-b-but my future... Have you seriously considered what defeat will do to my future?!',
  'There’s something about the phrase “diamond in the rough” that makes me hungry. ',
  'What? Are you broken already?',
  'You can’t lose yet! You have to entertain me more! ',
  'What? Are you through already? As an overlord, you’re totally not worth serving. ',
  'What? Is it already over? We still have lots of time.',
  'Hey, wait! That was crazy fast! I guess we can go ahead and stop. ',
  'What? This kid is a fast learner? Hahaha... I-I knew that, of course!',
  'Huh... If only I had been able to catch that Poké Ball that time... ',
  'What? You say that was over five seconds?! Time moves differently in my world, OK?!',
  'Ahaha... How was it? I bet that made you dizzy. ',
  'What? You’re done already? No, I’ll have none of that!',
  'People shouldn’t trust their eyes to judge things. ',
  'What?! Even I can lose?! But I’m a battling genius!',
  'You’re a smart Trainer, considering you don’t know very much. ',
  'WHAT?! It’s already time? And we can’t go into overtime!',
  'See, see? Time’s already up. You were a bit too tough. ',
  'Whatever your dream is, if you want to make it a reality, you have to do what it takes. ',
  'Whatever. That’s, like, sooo amazing. You really showed me, huh? Really.',
  'I made notes of all the things I need to watch out for. I’ll take preventive measures before my next battle! ',
  'What’d you think of my Poké Ball collection? Pokémon don’t matter to me! ',
  'Wha—? You wanna battle with me? I suppose we could arrange something...',
  'Experience begets power! Isn’t that what they say?! Anyway, won’t you battle me? ',
  'When adventure comes calling for me, it’s bye-bye to my harsh reality! ',
  'When I am surrounded by nature, most other things cease to matter.',
  'When I’m living without nature in my life, sometimes I’ll suddenly feel an anxiety attack coming on. ',
  'When I look at a special person like you, I just melt.',
  'Not throwing a tantrum when you lose is part of being a Trainer, right? ',
  'When I said that the world was calling me, my mom told me to get a job. ',
  'When my hairstyle is looking really sharp, it gets me really fired up! ',
  'When people call me a Beauty, they don’t realize how much pressure that puts on me. ',
  'When you’re dressed like this and say cute things, you’re pretty popular with lonely guys. ',
  'Whether you give it your all or slack off... All that matters in the end is who wins...',
  'I may be a newcomer and a Rising Star, but I’m already 39. ',
  'Who needs a gallery, huh?! The streets are my art show!',
  'I think it’s a crime for someone with no taste to make a work for public display. ',
  'Who was I kidding—going on a trip? At home, I just hide inside. By myself...',
  'I wouldn’t have come if I had known it was going to be this kind of tour! Give me my money back! ',
  'Who was it?! Who’s the bad-mouther who said that I’m just barely skating by, huh?!',
  'I’m only good on Roller Skates. I can’t skateboard or snowboard at all. ',
  'Whoa! The world is falling into the hands of evil! Are we headed for an unhappy ending? ',
  'Whoa! You are incredible! I’m amazed and surprised! ',
  'Whoa-ho! Sorry for jumping to conclusions! Who’d have ever guessed you were strong!',
  'Haha! I expected no less from the Champion! I am deeply grateful to have been your opponent! ',
  'Whoa... I’m totally on edge... If that had gone on any longer, I would’ve cried! ',
  'Why did it turn out like this? Didn’t my Pokémon like the feed I was using?! ',
  'Why do people compete and fight? This is the subject of my research.',
  'I’ve researched on top of research... At last I have derived the answer... ',
  'Why don’t my cuties say anything? Why do they seem in such a bad temper?',
  '...Bye. ',
  'Why’d I bother screwing up my courage to come on a trip anyway? I should’ve just stayed home...',
  'I paid all that money to battle? What weirdo would want to do that? ',
  'Winning bells are ringing, winning bells are ringing. Ding ding dong! Ding ding dong!',
  'I really can’t take sleeping all huddled together with my coworkers in a big room. ',
  'Winning, losing—in the end, it’s all luck. But if it’s fun, isn’t that enough? ',
  'Woo-hoo! My husband got food poisoning, so now I get to do whatever I want to do!',
  'My trip isn’t over yet! I’ll keep on traveling! ',
  'Woo-hoo! Take that! Were you knocked out by this Madame’s charm, or what?! ',
  'Wow! Seriously? I won a battle?! There’s no way I’m going back now! ',
  'Wow! You’re amazing! You’ve trained some great Pokémon! ',
  'Y-you defeated the symbol of our love... Does that mean that we’re over already?',
  'I don’t want to go home! I want to stay here forever! I want to live here for the rest of my life! ',
  'Y-you... How can this be... It is like seeing my former master alive in the flesh again!',
  'I just got into a fight with my boss. He made me mad, so now I’m slackin’ off! ',
  'Yahoo! Ya-hoooooo! I did it! I won again! ',
  'Yahoo! YAHOO! I did it! I won again! ',
  'Yahoo! Yahooooo!! Hear my cry of triumph! ',
  'Yay! Pokémon battles are the best! Battles are what I live for! ',
  'Yay! Thanks for going easy on me!  ',
  'Yay! Yay! I won! My Pokémon and I are amazing, huh?! ',
  'Yeah! Meow! I haz victory, meow! (I seriously want to quit this job.)',
  'Thank you! ',
  'Yes! I’m a Rich Boy! ',
  'Yes, a man must take at least one great journey! Even if my $1 flight ended up costing me $400...',
  'I made some wonderful memories. Thank you very much, local boy/girl. ',
  'Yes, a mere half year ago I was a Black Belt! Quite the transformation, wouldn’t you say? ',
  'Yes, the harshness of that defeat... The bitterness on my tongue now... It’s perfect! ',
  'Yes, traveling through time... That’s how I go!',
  'Why would this place be included in the tour? ',
  'Yes... I shall name this piece... “The Pitiful and Somehow Unsightly Youth.”',
  'Umm-hmmm... Thanks. If that’s all you got, then never mind. ',
  'Yes... I shall name this piece... “The Tragic and Yet Alluringly Beautiful Artist”!',
  'What excellent Pokémon you have! Please become my model! ',
  'Yesterday was a party. Today is a battle. I’m rich—I always have fun! ',
  'Yo! Yo! Yo!',
  'Yo! Yo! Yo! ',
  'Yo!',
  'Yo! ',
  'Yo!',
  'Yo! ',
  'Yo, kid! Are you new? I’m the Worker that everybody’s always talking about.',
  'You’re acting pretty brave for a half-pint! You may have bitten off more than you can chew! ',
  'Yo. You ready to start this already? I ain’t long in the way of patience. ',
  'You actually taught me a lesson! You’re pretty amazing! ',
  'You amazed? You surprised? By the power of my Pokémon?! ',
  'You are a strong Trainer. Forgive my impertinence.',
  'I guess you could say I expected this, or— how shall I put it—you gave me a wicked match. ',
  'You are just too, too cute. You are! I want to see you again. I’ll be waiting!',
  'Oh... Trainer... Isn’t it time...for a battle? ',
  'You are too inefficient. You need to be more quick and responsive.',
  'If you waste all of your time, you’ll never grow as a Trainer. ',
  'You are what you eat, n’est-ce pas? And it seems you could use a pinch of ze winning.',
  'Ze bitterness and ze sourness, zey are also ze important parts of ze flavor, no? ',
  'You can learn much from a mature woman, such as wisdom, grace, and good manners. ',
  'You can’t erase your bad memories. But what you can do is act crazy to fool everybody. ',
  'You certainly look pleased with yourself. Just being near you makes me gloomy.',
  'Kind people are really scary... Why do they have to come so close to me? ',
  'You did pick on me, after all, but I like you ’cause you’re strong! ',
  'You didn’t let up at all, even against a little kid! Yer a bad guy, just like I said! ',
  'You didn’t pick on me. So I guess I like you! ',
  'You didn’t win alone. You couldn’t have won without your Pokémon.',
  'You did it! Next time, you’ll put me through the wringer, huh? ',
  'You don’t have to try to impress me. You can lose against me.',
  'The adrenaline is pumping in my team! Me, too! I’ll make this an awesome battle! ',
  'You don’t know anything about the world. I think you’ll struggle in the future. ',
  'You don’t meet the prerequisites for admission. First, I recommend that you get stronger. ',
  'You don’t seem to need any tips for training good Pokémon.',
  'The hardest part of this job is saying farewell to Pokémon. ',
  'You don’t understand? Well, neither do I. It’s really just something I heard somewhere.',
  'I’m a Gardener, so my real job is gardening. ',
  'You expect too much of something famous, and you just end up disappointed by reality. ',
  'You got the details right in that battle... Do you even save time to eat? ',
  'You graciously allowed a win to someone so inexperienced that I still have my baby teeth. I thank you! ',
  'You had me sweating bullets there! That’s what being young is all about!',
  'I think this result is an investment in my future. ',
  'You have served me a spicy defeat. And yet defeat is also part of life.',
  'It’s too late to tell time to stop. I’m glad I enjoyed myself when I was young. ',
  'You have shown quite the cutting prowess... I shall sharpen my shears to face you again.',
  'I knew I hated humans! All I need is scissors! ',
  'You have to cut down on resistance if you want to go as fast as you can!',
  'I’m really cheap by nature, so I’m not cut out to be a Roller Skater. ',
  'You have to make a lot of sacrifices to be a Beauty. I’m done with that effort. Moving on! ',
  'You have your way. And I have my way. ',
  'You haven’t drawn out the natural flavors of your Pokémon. ',
  'You know how to make your way in the world. I think you’ll succeed in the future. ',
  'You know, I am very popular thanks to this costume of mine. ',
  'You know, the prices in this region are really quite something, aren’t they!',
  'You know, the prices in this region really are low, aren’t they? ',
  'You like a big fight, don’t ya? You’re my new pal! ',
  'You look so serious and boring... Can you keep me entertained? ',
  'You lose interest in whatever you do for a living, don’t you? ',
  'You lost to a Preschooler... And how old are you again? ',
  'You may think I’m just babbling, but I sure love my artistic dabbling!',
  'Ahh... That’s the kind of passion I’ve been looking for! ',
  'You must be tired. Please do rest awhile. ',
  'You must face off against my super-powered-up Pokémon!',
  'If you follow a fixed set of rules, you can get a definite result. ',
  'You need to feel it more! More! Or you’ll never win!',
  'I feel great! The best! Just like that! Listen to me worshipfully! ',
  'You only ever get one life to live. Are you doing what you want to do? ',
  'You really are an amateur. No sweat. (Whew... That was a little too close!)',
  'Catching Poké Balls before they open is a surefire way to win that I devised. ',
  'You see that? I’ll be fine as long as I listen to my mom.',
  'It’s just as my father said... History is written by the winners. ',
  'You see, playing with Pokémon is fun. I want to study Pokémon. ',
  'You see, you cannot win, because you are very weak.',
  'Even in victory, it is auspicious to remain nonchalant, humble, and subdued. ',
  'You see? My cuties teach me all kinds of good things.',
  '...Go away. ',
  'You see? My Pokémon are very loyal to me, aren’t they? ',
  'You seem quite confident. I’ll sink you straightaway.',
  'Your Pokémon... Show them to me... ',
  'You should not get angry at your Pokémon, even if you lose a battle.',
  'Right? Pretty good Pokémon, huh? I’m suited to raising things. ',
  'You should remember this: I am a Poké Fan. ',
  'You wanna fight me? You do know I come from a long line of punks, right? You’ve got guts, at least.',
  'Hmmph... What’s so great about Trainers? You don’t battle yourself, but you sure do talk big. ',
  'You, keep trying. Master the basics.',
  'Leaving already? I had just made some tea, though. ',
  'You... Thank you... Now my journey can come to an end... ',
  'Your battle is too cute, too! Let’s play again sometime.',
  'Oh... Trainer... Isn’t it time...for a battle? ',
  'Your battling was bland, I’m afraid. What did you expect to happen when you’re so unseasoned? ',
  'Your defeat is another small step toward my dreams coming true!',
  'I don’t know what they mean, but people say I’m a diamond in the rough! ',
  'Your fickle tenderness is piercing my heart. ',
  'Your fighting style suits you very well. You could be an Ace Trainer.',
  'You can’t become an Ace Trainer battling like that. ',
  'Your opponent will be me, the Pokémon Fan Club’s greatest battler! ',
  'Your Pokémon are more amazing! Trade with me! ',
  'Your Pokémon have a strength beyond the power of science.',
  'Th-this isn’t beyond the anticipated results! This is still a predictable result! ',
  'Your Pokémon seem to be lacking a wee bit in the power department, friend.',
  'Life is just a series of happenings, one after the next. Can you keep up? ',
  'Your taste in Pokémon is truly awful, but you are a first-class Trainer! ',
  'Your taste in Pokémon is wonderful, but you are a disappointment as a Trainer. ',
  'Your way must be rocky. Good luck to you. I am behind you all the way. ',
  'Youth is just youth. I wish I had realized it back then. ',
  'You’d best not send out any weak Pokémon! Your opponent is my partner in construction! ',
  'You’d better go easy on me, OK? Though I’ll be seriously fighting!',
  'School is boring. I’ve got nothing to do. Yawn. I’m only battling to kill the time. ',
  'You’d better remember this for your future, kid. Nothing ruins a honeymoon quite like a spouse!',
  'There’s no romance or anything else for me in a country where I don’t speak the language. ',
  'You’ll be fine if you buy my DVD of Pokémon training tips.',
  'You’ve raised your Pokémon well. Are you a passionate Trainer, or do you have a lot of free time on your hands? ',
  'You’ll be perfect if you buy my book of Pokémon training tips.',
  'I give each one two full days of cherishing, and then it’s on to the next! ',
  'You’re a rather delicate-looking little thing, hmm? Sure you’re up for a battle?',
  'Wow...wow... Am I wrong, or are you the Champion? ',
  'You’re a strong one, sure ’nough. But I don’t plan to lose next time! ',
  'You’re a strong Trainer, so I think I was just lucky this time.',
  'Hmmph... To challenge me must mean that even ignorance has its limit! ',
  'You’re actually good, aren’t you? Join the Pokémon Fan Club! ',
  'You’re carrying bulky luggage, but do you really need it all?',
  'What makes this place a resort? There’s nothing but serious Trainers here! ',
  'You’re even wilder than my new husband... Oh no, this is just...',
  'There’s no way this is good for my bank account. I know it’s wrong, but the comfort is irresistible! ',
  'You’re no good at all, I tell ya! Wanna hide away in the mountains with me? ',
  'You’re not bad, but you’re immature. Come back when you’ve learned a bit.',
  'If you hurry up and grow up, you can have more fun, too. ',
  'You’re not that strong, so we don’t need you in our café.',
  'It feels like I’m going to waste my youth just going back and forth between here and my part-time job. ',
  'You’re only young once. And you only get one shot at a given battle. Soon, you’ll be nothing but a memory. ',
  'You’re too soft to face off against a bad guy! You’re making things harder on yourself. ',
  'You’re very sharp! You didn’t fall for my fake sickness, huh?',
  'I, umm, can’t let my daughter, umm, see this. She can’t see her dad, umm, lose. ',
  'You’ve got to enjoy a fad while you still can, right? ',
  'Yowza! What a strong Trainer! Come to my café next time, OK?',
  'I may not be good at studying, but working is really fun for me. ',
  'Yum-yummm, you all look delicious... Bagon appetite! ',
  'Y’know, the truth is I really wanna be a normal girl and be all lovey-dovey with a normal boyfriend...',
  'I chose the path of the Punk Girl. Not being popular is getting to me, though... ',
  '’Sup! Good work. I tried everything I could, but I’m still pretty disappointed, yo!',
  'At the end of a battle, out of breath... How cool is it? Totally! ',
  '’Sup! I’ll give it all I’ve got! Let’s do our best!!',
  'The sweat that drips before a battle... Don’t you love how cool it is? ',
  '’Sup! That’s enough, friend! You gotta value your life, yo!',
  'Being tired from battle with disheveled clothing... It’s cool! Isn’t it actually the coolest? ',
  '“Harsh” and “bitter” are flavors in any good Chef’s repertoire! Would you like a taste? ',
  '“It’s even better than I thought it would be!” If you can think that, you’ll walk away happy. ',
  '“Une apple a day keeps ze doctor away.” Are you familiahr with zis saying?',
  '“Zere eez no accounting for taste.” Zis saying—do you know eet? '
